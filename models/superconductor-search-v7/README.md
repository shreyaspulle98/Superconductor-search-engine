  - 'A fault current limiter (FCL), also known as fault current controller (FCC),
    is a device which limits the prospective fault current when a fault occurs (e.g.
    in a power transmission network) without complete disconnection.  The term includes
    superconducting, solid-state and inductive devices.



    == Applications ==

    Electric power distribution systems include circuit breakers to disconnect power
    in case of a fault, but to maximize reliability, they wish to disconnect the smallest
    possible portion of the network.  This means that even the smallest circuit breakers,
    as well as all wiring to them, must be able to disconnect large fault currents.

    A problem arises if the electricity supply is upgraded, by adding new generation
    capacity or by adding cross-connections.  Because these increase the amount of
    power that can be supplied, all of the branch circuits must have their bus bars
    and circuit breakers upgraded to handle the new higher fault current limit.

    This poses a particular problem when distributed generation, such as wind farms
    and rooftop solar power, is added to an existing electric grid.  It is desirable
    to be able to add additional power sources without large system-wide upgrades.

    A simple solution is to add electrical impedance to the circuit.  This limits
    the rate at which current can increase, which limits the level the fault current
    can rise to before the breaker is opened.  However, this also limits the ability
    of the circuit to satisfy rapidly changing demand, so the addition or removal
    of large loads causes unstable power.

    A fault current limiter is a nonlinear element which has a low impedance at normal
    current levels, but presents a higher impedance at fault current levels.  Further,
    this change is extremely rapid, before a circuit breaker can trip a few milliseconds
    later.  (High-power circuit breakers are synchronized to the alternating current
    zero crossing to minimize arcing.)

    While the power is unstable during the fault, it is not completely disconnected.  After
    the faulting branch is disconnected, the fault current limiter automatically returns
    to normal operation.



    == Superconducting fault current limiter ==

    Superconducting fault current limiters exploit the extremely rapid loss of superconductivity
    (called "quenching") above a critical combination of temperature, current density,
    and magnetic field.  In normal operation, current flows through the superconductor
    without resistance and negligible impedance.

    If a fault develops, the superconductor quenches, its resistance rises sharply,
    and current is diverted to a parallel circuit with the desired higher impedance.
    (The structure is not usable as a circuit breaker, because the normally-conducting
    superconductive material does not have a high enough resistance.  It is only high
    enough to cause sufficient heating to melt the material.)

    Superconducting fault current limiters are described as being in one of two major
    categories: resistive or inductive.

    In a resistive FCL, the current passes directly through the superconductor.  When
    it quenches, the sharp rise in resistance reduces the fault current from what
    it would otherwise be (the prospective fault current). A resistive FCL can be
    either DC or AC. If it is AC, then there will be a steady power dissipation from
    AC losses (superconducting hysteresis losses) which must be removed by the cryogenic
    system. An AC FCL is usually made from wire wound non-inductively; otherwise the
    inductance of the device would create an extra constant power loss on the system.

    Inductive FCLs come in many variants, but the basic concept is a transformer with
    a resistive FCL as the secondary. In un-faulted operation, there is no resistance
    in the secondary and so the inductance of the device is low. A fault current quenches
    the superconductor, the secondary becomes resistive and the inductance of the
    whole device rises. The advantage of this design is that there is no heat ingress
    through current leads into the superconductor, and so the cryogenic power load
    may be lower. However, the large amount of iron required means that inductive
    FCLs are much bigger and heavier than resistive FCLs.  The first successful field
    test of an HTS FCL of this type was by SC Power Systems, a division of Zenergy
    Power plc in 2009.

    The quench process is a two-step process.  First, a small region quenches directly
    in response to a high current density.  This section rapidly heats by Joule heating,
    and the increase in temperature quenches adjacent regions.GridON Ltd has developed
    the first commercial inductive FCL for distribution & transmission networks. Using
    a unique and proprietary concept of magnetic-flux alteration - requiring no superconducting
    or cryogenic components - the self-triggered FCL instantaneously increases its
    impedance tenfold upon fault condition. It limits the fault current for its entire
    duration and recovers to its normal condition immediately thereafter. This inductive
    FCL is scalable to extra high voltage ratings.

    == Inductive fault current limiter ==



    == Development of the superconducting fault current limiters ==

    FCLs are under active development. In 2007, there were at least six national and
    international projects using magnesium diboride wire or YBCO tape, and two using
    BSCCO-2212 rods. Countries active in FCL development are Germany, the UK, the
    US, Korea and China. In 2007, the US Department of Energy spent $29m on three
    FCL development projects.

    High temperature superconductors are required for practical FCLs.  AC losses generate
    constant heat inside the superconductor, and the cost of cryogenic cooling at
    liquid helium temperatures required by low temperature superconductors makes the
    whole device uneconomic.

    First applications for FCLs are likely to  be used to help control medium-voltage
    electricity distribution systems, followed by electric-drive ships: naval vessels,
    submarines and cruise ships. Larger FCLs may eventually be deployed in high-voltage
    transmission systems.

  - 'In solid-state physics, the electronic band structure (or simply band structure)
    of a solid describes the range of energy levels that electrons may have within
    it, as well as the ranges of energy that they may not have (called band gaps or
    forbidden bands).

    Band theory derives these bands and band gaps by examining the allowed quantum
    mechanical wave functions for an electron in a large, periodic lattice of atoms
    or molecules. Band theory has been successfully used to explain many physical
    properties of solids, such as electrical resistivity and optical absorption, and
    forms the foundation of the understanding of all solid-state devices (transistors,
    solar cells, etc.).


    Why bands and band gaps occur

    The formation of electronic bands and band gaps can be illustrated with two complementary
    models for electrons in solids. The first one is the nearly free electron model,
    in which the electrons are assumed to move almost freely within the material.
    In this model, the electronic states rese'
  - "Superconducting radio frequency (SRF) science and technology involves the application\
    \ of electrical superconductors to radio frequency devices.  The ultra-low electrical\
    \ resistivity of a superconducting material allows an RF resonator to obtain an\
    \ extremely high quality factor, Q.  For example, it is commonplace for a 1.3\
    \ GHz niobium SRF resonant cavity at 1.8 kelvins to obtain a quality factor of\
    \ Q=5×1010.  Such a very high Q resonator stores energy with very low loss and\
    \ narrow bandwidth. These properties can be exploited for a variety of applications,\
    \ including the construction of high-performance particle accelerator structures.\n\
    \n\n== Introduction ==\nThe amount of loss in an SRF resonant cavity is so minute\
    \ that it is often explained with the following comparison: Galileo Galilei (1564–1642)\
    \ was one of the first investigators of pendulous motion, a simple form of mechanical\
    \ resonance. Had Galileo experimented with a 1 Hz resonator with a quality factor\
    \ Q typical of today's SRF cavities and left it swinging in an entombed lab since\
    \ the early 17th century, that pendulum would still be swinging today with about\
    \ half of its original amplitude.\nThe most common application of superconducting\
    \ RF is in particle accelerators. Accelerators typically use resonant RF cavities\
    \ formed from or coated with superconducting materials. Electromagnetic fields\
    \ are excited in the cavity by coupling in an RF source with an antenna.  When\
    \ the RF fed by the antenna is the same as that of a cavity mode, the resonant\
    \ fields build to high amplitudes. Charged particles passing through apertures\
    \ in the cavity are then accelerated by the electric fields and deflected by the\
    \ magnetic fields.  The resonant frequency driven in SRF cavities typically ranges\
    \ from 200 MHz to 3 GHz, depending on the particle species to be accelerated.\n\
    The most common fabrication technology for such SRF cavities is to form thin walled\
    \ (1–3 mm) shell components from high purity niobium sheets by stamping. These\
    \ shell components are then welded together to form cavities.\nA simplified diagram\
    \ of the key elements of an SRF cavity setup is shown below.  The cavity is immersed\
    \ in a saturated liquid helium bath. Pumping removes helium vapor boil-off and\
    \ controls the bath temperature.  The helium vessel is often pumped to a pressure\
    \ below helium's superfluid lambda point to take advantage of the superfluid's\
    \ thermal properties. Because superfluid has very high thermal conductivity, it\
    \ makes an excellent coolant. In addition, superfluids boil only at free surfaces,\
    \ preventing the formation of bubbles on the surface of the cavity, which would\
    \ cause mechanical perturbations.  An antenna is needed in the setup to couple\
    \ RF power to the cavity fields and, in turn, any passing particle beam.  The\
    \ cold portions of the setup need to be extremely well insulated, which is best\
    \ accomplished by a vacuum vessel surrounding the helium vessel and all ancillary\
    \ cold components.  The full SRF cavity containment system, including the vacuum\
    \ vessel and many details not discussed here, is a cryomodule.\n\nEntry into superconducting\
    \ RF technology can incur more complexity, expense, and time than normal-conducting\
    \ RF cavity strategies.  SRF requires chemical facilities for harsh cavity treatments,\
    \ a low-particulate cleanroom for high-pressure water rinsing and assembly of\
    \ components, and complex engineering for the cryomodule vessel and cryogenics.\
    \  A vexing aspect of SRF is the as-yet elusive ability to consistently produce\
    \ high Q cavities in high volume production, which would be required for a large\
    \ linear collider.  Nevertheless, for many applications the capabilities of SRF\
    \ cavities provide the only solution for a host of demanding performance requirements.\n\
    Several extensive treatments of SRF physics and technology are available, many\
    \ of them free of charge and online.  There are the proceedings of CERN accelerator\
    \ schools, a scientific paper giving a thorough presentation of the many aspects\
    \ of an SRF cavity to be used in the International Linear Collider, bi-annual\
    \ International Conferences on RF Superconductivity held at varying global locations\
    \ in odd numbered years, and tutorials presented at the conferences.\n\n\n== SRF\
    \ cavity application in particle accelerators ==\n\nA large variety of RF cavities\
    \ are used in particle accelerators.  Historically most have been made of copper\
    \ – a good electrical conductor – and operated near room temperature with exterior\
    \ water cooling to remove the heat generated by the electrical loss in the cavity.\
    \  In the past two decades, however, accelerator facilities have increasingly\
    \ found superconducting cavities to be more suitable (or necessary) for their\
    \ accelerators than normal-conducting copper versions.  The motivation for using\
    \ superconductors in RF cavities is not to achieve a net power saving, but rather\
    \ to increase the quality of the particle beam being accelerated.  Though superconductors\
    \ have little AC electrical resistance, the little power they do dissipate is\
    \ radiated at very low temperatures, typically in a liquid helium bath at 1.6\
    \ K to 4.5 K, and maintaining such low temperatures takes a lot of energy.  The\
    \ refrigeration power required to maintain the cryogenic bath at low temperature\
    \ in the presence of heat from small RF power dissipation is dictated by the Carnot\
    \ efficiency, and can easily be comparable to the normal-conductor power dissipation\
    \ of a room-temperature copper cavity.  The principle motivations for using superconducting\
    \ RF cavities, are:\n\nHigh duty cycle or cw operation.  SRF cavities allow the\
    \ excitation of high electromagnetic fields at high duty cycle, or even cw, in\
    \ such regimes that a copper cavity's electrical loss could melt the copper, even\
    \ with robust water cooling.\nLow beam impedance.  The low electrical loss in\
    \ an SRF cavity allows their geometry to have large beampipe apertures while still\
    \ maintaining a high accelerating field along the beam axis.  Normal-conducting\
    \ cavities need small beam apertures to concentrate the electric field as compensation\
    \ for power losses in wall currents.  However, the small apertures can be deleterious\
    \ to a particle beam due to their spawning of larger wakefields, which are quantified\
    \ by the accelerator parameters termed \"beam impedance\" and \"loss parameter\"\
    .\nNearly all RF power goes to the beam.  The RF source driving the cavity need\
    \ only provide the RF power that is absorbed by the particle beam being accelerated,\
    \ since the RF power dissipated in the SRF cavity walls is negligible.  This is\
    \ in contrast to normal-conducting cavities where the wall power loss can easily\
    \ equal or exceed the beam power consumption.  The RF power budget is important\
    \ since the RF source technologies, such as a Klystron, Inductive output tube\
    \ (IOT), or solid state amplifier, have costs that increase dramatically with\
    \ increasing power.\nWhen future advances in superconducting material science\
    \ allow higher superconducting critical temperatures Tc and consequently higher\
    \ SRF bath temperatures, then the reduced thermocline between the cavity and the\
    \ surrounding environment could yield a significant net power savings by SRF over\
    \ the normal conducting approach to RF cavities.  Other issues will need to be\
    \ considered with a higher bath temperature, though, such as the fact that superfluidity\
    \ (which is presently exploited with liquid helium) would not be present with\
    \ (for example) liquid nitrogen.  At present, none of the \"high Tc\" superconducting\
    \ materials are suitable for RF applications.  Shortcomings of these materials\
    \ arise due to their underlying physics as well as their bulk mechanical properties\
    \ not being amenable to fabricating accelerator cavities.  However, depositing\
    \ films of promising materials onto other mechanically amenable cavity materials\
    \ may provide a viable option for exotic materials serving SRF applications. \
    \ At present, the de facto choice for SRF material is still pure niobium, which\
    \ has a critical temperature of 9.3 K and functions as a superconductor nicely\
    \ in a liquid helium bath of 4.2 K or lower, and has excellent mechanical properties.\n\
    \n\n== Physics of SRF cavities ==\nThe physics of Superconducting RF can be complex\
    \ and lengthy.  A few simple approximations derived from the complex theories,\
    \ though, can serve to provide some of the important parameters of SRF cavities.\n\
    By way of background, some of the pertinent parameters of RF cavities are itemized\
    \ as follows.  A resonator's quality factor is defined by\n\n  \n    \n      \n\

    f is the frequency in [Hz],\nT is the temperature in [K], and\nTc=9.3 K for niobium,\
    \ so this approximation is valid for T<4.65 K.\nNote that for superconductors,\
    \ the BCS resistance increases quadratically with frequency, ~f 2, whereas for\
    \ normal conductors the surface resistance increases as the root of frequency,\
    \ ~√f.  For this reason, the majority of superconducting cavity applications favor\
    \ lower frequencies, <3 GHz, and normal-conducting cavity applications favor higher\
    \ frequencies, >0.5 GHz, there being some overlap depending on the application.\n\
    The superconductor's residual resistance arises from several sources, such as\
    \ random material defects, hydrides that can form on the surface due to hot chemistry\
    \ and slow cool-down, and others that are yet to be identified.  One of the quantifiable\
    \ residual resistance contributions is due to an external magnetic field pinning\
    \ magnetic fluxons in a Type II superconductor.  The pinned fluxon cores create\
    \ small normal-conducting regions in the niobium that can be summed to estimate\

    \ magnetic field in [Oe],\nHc2 is the Type II superconductor magnetic quench field,\
    \ which is 2400 Oe (190 kA/m) for niobium, and\nRn is the normal-conducting resistance\
    \ of niobium in ohms.\nThe Earth's nominal magnetic flux of 0.5 gauss (50 μT)\
    \ translates to a magnetic field of 0.5 Oe (40 A/m) and would produce a residual\
    \ surface resistance in a superconductor that is orders of magnitude greater than\
    \ the BCS resistance, rendering the superconductor too lossy for practical use.\
    \  For this reason, superconducting cavities are surrounded by magnetic shielding\
    \ to reduce the field permeating the cavity to typically <10 mOe (0.8 A/m).\n\
    Using the above approximations for a niobium a SRF cavity at 1.8 K, 1.3 GHz, and\
    \ assuming a magnetic field of 10 mOe (0.8 A/m), the surface resistance components\
    \ would be\n\nRBCS = 4.55 nΩ and\nRres = RH = 3.42 nΩ, giving a net surface resistance\n\
    Rs = 7.97 nΩ.  If for this cavity\nG = 270 Ω then the ideal quality factor would\
    \ be\nQo = 3.4×1010.\nThe Qo just described can be further improved by up to a\
    \ factor of 2 by performing a mild vacuum bake of the cavity.  Empirically, the\
    \ bake seems to reduce the BCS resistance by 50%, but increases the residual resistance\
    \ by 30%.  The plot below shows the ideal Qo values for a range of residual magnetic\
    \ field for a baked and unbaked cavity.\n\nIn general, much care and attention\
    \ to detail must be exercised in the experimental setup of SRF cavities so that\
    \ there is not Qo degradation due to RF losses in ancillary components, such as\
    \ stainless steel vacuum flanges that are too close to the cavity's evanescent\
    \ fields.  However, careful SRF cavity preparation and experimental configuration\
    \ have achieved the ideal Qo not only for low field amplitudes, but up to cavity\
    \ fields that are typically 75% of the magnetic field quench limit.  Few cavities\
    \ make it to the magnetic field quench limit since residual losses and vanishingly\
    \ small defects heat up localized spots, which eventually exceed the superconducting\
    \ critical temperature and lead to a thermal quench.\n\n\n== Q  vs E ==\nWhen\
    \ using superconducting RF cavities in particle accelerators, the field level\
    \ in the cavity should generally be as high as possible to most efficiently accelerate\
    \ the beam passing through it.  The Qo values described by the above calculations\
    \ tend to degrade as the fields increase, which is plotted for a given cavity\
    \ as a \"Q vs E\" curve, where \"E\" refers to the accelerating electric field\
    \ of the TM01 mode.  Ideally, the cavity Qo would remain constant as the accelerating\
    \ field is increased all the way up to the point of a magnetic quench field, as\
    \ indicated by the \"ideal\" dashed line in the plot below.  In reality, though,\
    \ even a well prepared niobium cavity will have a Q vs E curve that lies beneath\
    \ the ideal, as shown by the \"good\" curve in the plot.\nThere are many phenomena\
    \ that can occur in an SRF cavity to degrade its Q vs E performance, such as impurities\
    \ in the niobium, hydrogen contamination due to excessive heat during chemistry,\
    \ and a rough surface finish.  After a couple decades of development, a necessary\
    \ prescription for successful SRF cavity production is emerging.  This includes:\n\
    \nEddy-current scanning of the raw niobium sheet for impurities,\nGood quality\
    \ control of electron beam welding parameters,\nMaintaining low cavity temperatures\
    \ during acid chemistry to avoid hydrogen contamination,\nElectropolishing of\
    \ the cavity interior to achieve a very smooth surface,\nHigh pressure rinsing\
    \ (HPR) of the cavity interior in a clean room with filtered water to remove particulate\
    \ contamination,\nCareful assembly of the cavity and other vacuum apparatus in\
    \ a clean room with clean practices,\nA vacuum bake of the cavity at 120 °C for\
    \ 48 hours; this typically improves Qo by a factor of 2.\n\nThere remains some\
    \ uncertainty as to the root cause of why some of these steps lead to success,\
    \ such as the electropolish and vacuum bake.  However, if this prescription is\
    \ not followed, the Q vs E curve often shows an excessive degradation of Qo with\
    \ increasing field, as shown by the \"Q slope\" curve in the plot below.  Finding\
    \ the root causes of Q slope phenomena is the subject of ongoing fundamental SRF\
    \ research.  The insight gained could lead to simpler cavity fabrication processes\
    \ as well as benefit future material development efforts to find higher Tc alternatives\
    \ to niobium.\nIn 2012, the Q(E) dependence on SRF cavities discovered for the\
    \ first time in such a way that the Q-rise phenomenon was observed in Ti doped\
    \ SRF cavity. The quality factor increases with increase in accelerating field\
    \ and was explained by the presence of sharper peaks in the electronic density\
    \ of states at the gap edges in doped cavities and such peaks being broadened\
    \ by the rf current. Later the similar phenomenon was observed with nitrogen doping\
    \ and which has been the current state-of-art cavity preparation for high performance.\n\
    \n\n== Wakefields and higher order modes (HOMs) ==\nOne of the main reasons for\
    \ using SRF cavities in particle accelerators is that their large apertures result\
    \ in low beam impedance and higher thresholds of deleterious beam instabilities.\
    \  As a charged particle beam passes through a cavity, its electromagnetic radiation\
    \ field is perturbed by the sudden increase of the conducting wall diameter in\
    \ the transition from the small-diameter beampipe to the large hollow RF cavity.\
    \  A portion of the particle's radiation field is then \"clipped off\" upon re-entrance\
    \ into the beampipe and left behind as wakefields in the cavity.  The wakefields\
    \ are simply superimposed upon the externally driven accelerating fields in the\
    \ cavity.  The spawning of electromagnetic cavity modes as wakefields from the\
    \ passing beam is analogous to a drumstick striking a drumhead and exciting many\
    \ resonant mechanical modes.\nThe beam wakefields in an RF cavity excite a subset\
    \ of the spectrum of the many electromagnetic modes, including the externally\
    \ driven TM01 mode.  There are then a host of beam instabilities that can occur\
    \ as the repetitive particle beam passes through the RF cavity, each time adding\
    \ to the wakefield energy in a collection of modes.\nFor a particle bunch with\
    \ charge q, a length much shorter than the wavelength of a given cavity mode,\
    \ and traversing the cavity at time t=0, the amplitude of the wakefield voltage\
    \ left behind in the cavity in a given mode is given by \n\n  \n    \n      \n\

    \ bunches, and\nδ is the phase shift of the wakefield mode between bunch passages\
    \ through the cavity.\nAs an example calculation, let the phase shift δ=0, which\
    \ would be close to the case for the TM01 mode by design and unfortunately likely\
    \ to occur for a few HOM's.  Having δ=0 (or an integer multiple of an RF mode's\
    \ period, δ=n2π) gives the worse-case wakefield build-up, where successive bunches\
    \ are maximally decelerated by previous bunches' wakefields and give up even more\
    \ energy than with only their \"self wake\".  Then, taking ωo = 2π 500 MHz, Tb=1\
    \ μs, and QL=106, the buildup of wakefields would be Vss wake=637×Vwake.  A pitfall\
    \ for any accelerator cavity would be the presence of what is termed a \"trapped\
    \ mode\".  This is an HOM that does not leak out of the cavity and consequently\
    \ has a QL that can be orders of magnitude larger than used in this example. \
    \ In this case, the buildup of wakefields of the trapped mode would likely cause\
    \ a beam instability.  The beam instability implications due to the Vss wake wakefields\
    \ is thus addressed differently for the fundamental accelerating mode TM01 and\
    \ all other RF modes, as described next.\n\n\n=== Fundamental accelerating mode\
    \ TM010 ===\nThe complex calculations treating wakefield-related beam stability\
    \ for the TM010 mode in accelerators show that there are specific regions of phase\
    \ between the beam bunches and the driven RF mode that allow stable operation\
    \ at the highest possible beam currents.  At some point of increasing beam current,\
    \ though, just about any accelerator configuration will become unstable.  As pointed\
    \ out above, the beam wakefield amplitude is proportional to the cavity parameter\
    \ R/Qo, so this is typically used as a comparative measure of the likelihood of\
    \ TM01 related beam instabilities.  A comparison of R/Qo and R for a 500 MHz superconducting\
    \ cavity and a 500 MHz normal-conducting cavity is shown below.  The accelerating\
    \ voltage provided by both cavities is comparable for a given net power consumption\
    \ when including refrigeration power for SRF.  The R/Qo for the SRF cavity is\
    \ 15 times less than the normal-conducting version, and thus less beam-instability\
    \ susceptible.  This one of the main reasons such SRF cavities are chosen for\
    \ use in high-current storage rings.\n\n\n=== Higher order modes (HOMs) ===\n\n\
    In addition to the fundamental accelerating TM010 mode of an RF cavity, numerous\
    \ higher frequency modes and a few lower-frequency dipole modes are excited by\
    \ charged particle beam wakefields, all generally denoted higher order modes (HOMs).\
    \  These modes serve no useful purpose for accelerator particle beam dynamics,\
    \ only giving rise to beam instabilities, and are best heavily damped to have\
    \ as low a QL as possible.  The damping is accomplished by preferentially allowing\
    \ dipole and all HOMs to leak out of the SRF cavity, and then coupling them to\
    \ resistive RF loads.  The leaking out of undesired RF modes occurs along the\
    \ beampipe, and results from a careful design of the cavity aperture shapes. \
    \ The aperture shapes are tailored to keep the TM01 mode \"trapped\" with high\
    \ Qo inside of the cavity and allow HOMs to propagate away.  The propagation of\
    \ HOMs is sometimes facilitated by having a larger diameter beampipe on one side\
    \ of the cavity, beyond the smaller diameter cavity iris, as seen in the SRF cavity\
    \ CAD cross-section at the top of this wiki page.  The larger beampipe diameter\
    \ allows the HOMs to easily propagate away from the cavity to an HOM antenna or\
    \ beamline absorber.\nThe resistive load for HOMs can be implemented by having\
    \ loop antennas located at apertures on the side of the beampipe, with coaxial\
    \ lines routing the RF to outside of the cryostat to standard RF loads.  Another\
    \ approach is to place the HOM loads directly on the beampipe as hollow cylinders\
    \ with RF lossy material attached to the interior surface, as shown in the adjacent\
    \ image.  This \"beamline load\" approach can be more technically challenging,\
    \ since the load must absorb high RF power while preserving a high-vacuum beamline\
    \ environment in close proximity to a contamination-sensitive SRF cavity.  Further,\
    \ such loads must sometimes operate at cryogenic temperatures to avoid large thermal\
    \ gradients along the beampipe from the cold SRF cavity.  The benefit of the beamline\
    \ HOM load configuration, however, is a greater absorptive bandwidth and HOM attenuation\
    \ as compared to antenna coupling.  This benefit can be the difference between\
    \ a stable vs. an unstable particle beam for high current accelerators.\n\n\n\
    == Cryogenics ==\n\nA significant part of SRF technology is cryogenic engineering.\
    \  The SRF cavities tend to be thin-walled structures immersed in a bath of liquid\
    \ helium having temperature 1.6 K to 4.5 K.  Careful engineering is then required\
    \ to insulate the helium bath from the room-temperature external environment.\
    \  This is accomplished by:\n\nA vacuum chamber surrounding the cold components\
    \ to eliminate convective heat transfer by gases.\nMulti-layer insulation wrapped\
    \ around cold components.  This insulation is composed of dozens of alternating\
    \ layers of aluminized mylar and thin fiberglass sheet, which reflects infrared\
    \ radiation that shines through the vacuum insulation from the 300 K exterior\
    \ walls.\nLow thermal conductivity mechanical connections between the cold mass\
    \ and the room temperature vacuum vessel.  These connections are required, for\
    \ example, to support the mass of the helium vessel inside the vacuum vessel and\
    \ to connect the apertures in the SRF cavity to the accelerator beamline.  Both\
    \ types of connections transition from internal cryogenic temperatures to room\
    \ temperature at the vacuum vessel boundary.  The thermal conductivity of these\
    \ parts is minimized by having small cross sectional area and being composed of\
    \ low thermal conductivity material, such as stainless steel for the vacuum beampipe\
    \ and fiber reinforced epoxies (G10) for mechanical support.  The vacuum beampipe\
    \ also requires good electrical conductivity on its interior surface to propagate\
    \ the image currents of the beam, which is accomplished by about 100 μm of copper\
    \ plating on the interior surface.\nThe major cryogenic engineering challenge\
    \ is the refrigeration plant for the liquid helium.  The small power that is dissipated\
    \ in an SRF cavity and the heat leak to the vacuum vessel are both heat loads\
    \ at very low temperature.  The refrigerator must replenish this loss with an\
    \ inherent poor efficiency, given by the product of the Carnot efficiency ηC and\
    \ a \"practical\" efficiency ηp.  The Carnot efficiency derives from the second\
    \ law of thermodynamics and can be quite low.  It is given by\n\n  \n    \n  \

    \ temperature.  Atmospheric pressure is 760 Torr (101.325 kPa), corresponding\

  - "INTRODUCTION\nQuestion: What is the diﬀerence between a Fermi liquid and a non-Fermi\
    \ liquid?\nAnswer: The diﬀerence is the same as the one between bananas and non-bananas.\n\
    Boris Altschuler (2001)\nUnconventional or “nodal” superconductors appeared on\
    \ the scene in 1979, when the heavy-fermion superconductor\nCeCu2Si2 and the organic\
    \ superconducting Bechgaard salts (TMTSF)2PF6 were discovered. Since then, many\
    \ more\nheavy-fermion superconductors [1] and organic superconductors [2] have\
    \ been synthesized. This development was\nfollowed by the epoch making discovery\
    \ of high-Tc cuprate superconductor La2−xBaxCuO4 by Bednorz and M¨uller\n[3] with\
    \ the superconducting transition temperature Tc = 35K in 1986. Within a few years\
    \ new classes of high-Tc\ncuprates emerged, including YBa2Cu3O6+δ, La2−xSrxCuO4,\
    \ Bi2Sr2Ca1−xYxCu2O8+δ (Bi2212); and HgBa2CaCu2O6\nwith Tc = 145K. The subsequent\
    \ enthusiasm and confusion are well documented in an early review by Enz [4].\n\
    Confusion? Yes, initially it was thought that Landau’s Fermi liquid theory [5]\
    \ and the BCS theory [6] were no longer\napplicable.\nAmong many proposals one\
    \ of the most inﬂuential were Anderson’s dogmas [7], which can be summarized as\
    \ follows:\na. The action takes place in the CuO2 plane common to all high-Tc\
    \ cuprate superconductors.\nb. The undoped state is a Mott insulator with antiferromagnetic\
    \ (AF) order. Upon doping superconductivity\nappears. Therefore the simplest Hamiltonian\
    \ is the two-dimensional (2D) one-band Hubbard model:\nH = −t\nX\n⟨i,j⟩α\n(c+\n\
    iαcjα + h.c) + U\nX\ni\nni\x02ni\x03,\n(1)\nwhere ⟨i, j⟩connects the nearest neighbors\
    \ in the 2D square lattice. The c+\niα and ciα are creation and annihilation\n\
    operator for the holes at the site i with spin α and ni\x02 = c+\ni\x02ci\x02\
    .\nc. As a possible ground state of Eq. (1) Anderson proposed the resonating valence\
    \ bond (RVB) state:\nΨ =\nY\ni\n(1 −di)|BCS⟩,\n(2)\nwhere |BCS⟩is the BCS state\
    \ for s-wave superconductors [6], and Q\ni(1 −di) with di = ni\x02ni\x03 is called\
    \ the\nGutzwiller operator. Q\ni(1 −di) annihilates all doubly occupied states.\n\
    In spite of tremendous eﬀorts spent on both Eqs . (1) and (2) it has been diﬃcult\
    \ to ﬁnd solutions in two dimensions.\nOn the other hand the 1D version of Eq.\
    \ (1) is now completely understood [8,9]. In the meantime the perturbative\nanalyses\
    \ based on Eq. (1) predict BCS d-wave superconductivity in high-Tc cuprates [10,11,12,13].\n\
    2\nFIG. 1:\nLocal density of states around a single vortex for d-wave (left) and\
    \ s-wave superconductivity.\nHigh-quality single crystals of YBCO, LSCO and thin\
    \ ﬁlms of Bi2212 became available around 1992. The d-wave\nsuperconductivity in\
    \ these high-Tc cuprates was established in 1994. Among many experiments, angle-resolved\
    \ pho-\ntoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) [14] and Josephson interferometry [15,16]\
    \ played a crucial role. Around this time\nseveral theoretical groups started\
    \ to analyze the physical properties of d-wave superconductivity within the BCS\n\
    framework [17,18,19,20]. In 1993 Patrick Lee [21] demonstrated the universal heat\
    \ conduction in d-wave supercon-\nductors. Furthermore the thermal conductivity\
    \ was shown to increase with increasing impurity scattering [19]. This\ncounterintuitive\
    \ behavior was observed in the Zn-substituted YBCO in [22]. The electronic contribution\
    \ to the ther-\nmal conductivity in d-wave superconductors is proportional to\
    \ T at low temperatures (i.e. T ≪∆where ∆is the\nmaximum value of the energy gap).\
    \ Here we assume ∆(k) = ∆cos(2φ) and φ is the angle k in the a −b plane makes\n\
    from the a axis. Then in the limit of no impurity scattering (i.e. Γ →0 where\
    \ Γ is the quasiparticle scattering rate\nin the normal state) the thermal conductivity\
    \ is given by\nκ00\nT\n= k2\nB\n3ℏ\nv\nv2\nn,\n(3)\nwhere κ00/T = limΓ→0 κ/T ,\
    \ and v/v2 = EF /∆and n is the quasiparticle density or the hole density. The\
    \ velocities\nv and v2 are deﬁned from the quasiparticle energy at the Dirac cone\n\
    Ek =\nq\nv2(k∥−kF )2 + v2\n2k2\n⊥,\n(4)\nwhere v is the Fermi velocity, k∥is the\
    \ radial component of the wave vector and k⊥the component perpendicular to\nthe\
    \ Fermi surface.\nLater we shall derive Eq.(3) in Section IV. The thermal conductivity\
    \ in single crystals of optimally doped YBCO\nand Bi2212 below T = 1K was measured\
    \ by May Chiao et al [23,24]. Making use of Eq. (3) they found ∆/EF = 1/10\nand\
    \ 1/14 for Bi2212 and YBCO respectively. These remarkable ratios imply:\na. High-Tc\
    \ cuprates are described by the BCS theory of d-wave superconductivity. They are\
    \ far away from the\nBose-Einstein condensation limit which requires ∆∼EF [25].\n\
    b. According to the Ginzburg criterion, ﬂuctuation eﬀects are of the order ∆/EF\
    \ ∼(pF ξ)−1. In other words they\nshould be at most 10%. This appears to exclude\
    \ large phase ﬂuctuations and stripe phases discussed in [26,27].\nc. For ∆/EF\
    \ = 1/10 there are hundreds of quasiparticle bound states around the core of a\
    \ single vortex in d-wave\nsuperconductors [28,29]. The radial (r) dependence\
    \ of the local quasiparticle density of states is very similar\nto the one obtained\
    \ for s-wave superconductivity [30]. We show in Fig. 1 the local density of states\
    \ around a\nsingle vortex for a d-wave and s-wave superconductor. These are well-known\
    \ bound states ﬁrst discovered by\nCaroli, de-Gennes and Matricon [31,32] for\
    \ s-wave superconductors.\nIn earlier works [33,34,35,36] it was asserted that\
    \ there would be no bound state around a single vortex in d-wave\nsuperconductors.\n\
    However in these works it was assumed ∆≃EF in order to facilitate the numerical\
    \ analysis\n3\n0.05\n0.15\n0.25\n100\n500\n0\nx\nT\nTc\nT ∗\nAF\nd-wave SC\npseudogap\
    \ phase\nFIG. 2: The phase diagram of hole-doped high-Tc cuprate superconductors.\n\
    based on the lattice version of the Bogoliubov de Gennes equation.\nThis assumption\
    \ (∆≃EF ) eliminates the\nbound states in these numerical analyses.\nIf we limit\
    \ ourselves to the experiments on single crystals of high-Tc\ncuprate superconductors,\
    \ we ﬁnd that most of the behaviors observed are consistent with the BCS theory\
    \ of d-\nwave superconductivity [37]. Also it is better to use the continuum version\
    \ of the Bogoliubov de Gennes equation.\nwhich is proposed in [38] and used in\
    \ [28,29]. More recently a similar analysis is extended for a vortex in an f-wave\n\
    superconductor [39].\nFrom a theoretical point of view the universality of the\
    \ Landau Fermi liquid in 2D systems was demonstrated within\nthe renormalization\
    \ group analysis [40,41,42]. The quasiparticles in the normal state of high-Tc\
    \ cuprates appear to\nbe a Fermi liquid state. Furthermore the quasiparticles\
    \ in d-wave superconductors are in a BCS-Fermi liquid state\nwith the quasiparticle\
    \ energy\nEk =\nq\nv2(k∥−kF )2 + ∆2 cos2(2φ).\n(5)\nIn the vicinity of the Dirac\
    \ cone Eq. (5) reduces to Eq. (4).\nAnother consequence of the renormalization\
    \ group analysis is that the instability of the normal Fermi liquid is\nrelated\
    \ to the infrared divergence in the particle-particle (and the hole-hole) channel\
    \ or the particle-hole channel. The\nformer results in conventional or unconventional\
    \ superconductivity and the latter in conventional or unconventional\ndensity\
    \ wave states. Therefore it is of great interest to look at the phase diagram\
    \ of the high-Tc cuprates from this\npoint of view. We show a schematic phase\
    \ diagram in Fig. 2.\nLet us consider the hole-doped region. In the vicinity of\
    \ x = 0 there is an antiferromagnetic (AF) insulating phase,\nwhich is a Mott\
    \ insulator (MI). As the hole-doping x is increased, the AF order is rapidly suppressed\
    \ around x = 3%.\nThen a superconducting region develops for 5% < x < 25%. This\
    \ is sometimes called “the superconducting dome”.\nAlso in the underdoped region\
    \ there is the pseudogap (PG) regime. The nature of the pseudogap is still hotly\n\
    debated. There is evidence that it is a d-wave density wave (dDW) [43,44,45,46]\
    \ with an energy gap ∆(k) = ∆cos(2φ).\nEarlier proposals [43,45] have only considered\
    \ the commensurate case with Z2 symmetry something similar to a ﬂux\nphase [47,48].\n\
    On the contrary, we consider the incommensurate d-wave density wave [44,46] case\
    \ where the condensate has U(1)\nsymmetry as in conventional charge-density wave\
    \ systems (CDW). Here the phase vortex [49] is the most common\ntopological defect.\
    \ Moreover the phase diagram suggests a coexistence region of dDW and d-wave superconductivity\n\
    [43,45]. Then the phenomenological gap introduced by Tallon and Loram [50] should\
    \ be the energy gap associated\nwith dDW.\nRecently Laughlin [51] has pointed\
    \ out that the wave function (2) is impractical, since the Gutzwiller operator\
    \ has\nno inverse. Instead, he proposed to analyze Eq. (2) with a modiﬁed Gutzwiller\
    \ operator which has an inverse. For\nexample\nY\ni\n(1 −di)\n→\nY\ni\n(1 −αdi),\n\
    (6)\n4\nFIG. 3: From top left: 2D f-wave in Sr2RuO4, dx2−y2-wave in CeCoIn5 and\
    \ in κ-(ET)2Cu(NCS)2, (s + g)-wave in YNi2B2C,\n(p + h)-wave in the A phase of\
    \ PrOs4Sb12, (p + h)-wave in the B phase of PrOs4Sb12.\nwith α < 1. He called\
    \ this “gossamer superconductivity”. “Gossamer” means ﬁlmy cobweb or something\
    \ light, fragile\nbut strong. If we look at this new wave function with Eq. (6),\
    \ we realize that this is an example of competing order\nparameters [52,53]. We\
    \ shall come back to this question at the end of our course.\nIn a seminal paper\
    \ Volovik [54] has shown that the quasiparticle density of states in the vortex\
    \ state of the d-wave\nsuperconductors is calculable within a semiclassical approximation.\
    \ The predicted\n√\nH dependence of the speciﬁc\nheat has been conﬁrmed experimentally\
    \ in single crystals of YBCO [55,56], LSCO [57] and Sr2RuO4 [58,59]. This\nsemiclassical\
    \ approach has been extended in a variety of directions [60,61,62,63,64,65].\n\
    When high-quality single\ncrystals in the extremely clean limit (i.e. l ≫ξ where\
    \ l is the quasiparticle mean free path and ξ the superconducting\ncoherence length)\
    \ are available, the angle- dependent thermal conductivity in the vortex state\
    \ provides unique access\nto the gap symmetry ∆(k). In the last few years Izawa\
    \ et al. have determined ∆(k) in Sr2RuO4 [66], CeCoIn5 [67],\nκ-(ET)2Cu(NCS)2\
    \ [68], YNi2B2C [69] and PrOs4Sb12 [70,71]. These gap functions are shown in Fig.\
    \ 3.\nIn the following, we ﬁrst focus on the quasiparticle spectrum in a variety\
    \ of nodal superconductors. Then the eﬀect of\nimpurity scattering and the universal\
    \ heat conduction is brieﬂy summarized. The quasiclassical approximation in the\n\
    vortex state in nodal superconductors is the central part of this course. Also\
    \ the properties of nodal superconductivity\nin YNi2B2C and PrOs4Sb12 are brieﬂy\

    \ following, we consider a group of quasi-2D superconductors,\nwhose quasiparticle\

    \ 2D systems by a\ncylindrical Fermi surface, as in high-Tc cuprates, Sr2RuO4,\
    \ CeCoIn5, κ-(ET)2Cu(NCS)2 etc. Also we consider a\ngroup of nodal superconductors\
    \ with f(k) = cos(2φ), sin(2φ) (d-wave), e±iφ cos(χ) (f-wave), cos χ (d-wave),\
    \ sin χ\n(p-wave), e±iφ sin(χ) (d-wave), cos(2χ) (g-wave) etc. Here χ = ckz. Then\
    \ it can be readily shown (Exercise 1) that\nthese superconductors have an identical\
    \ quasiparticle density of states (DOS).\nWithin the mean-ﬁeld approximation,\
    \ i.e. the BCS approximation, Eq. (7) is transformed as\nH =\nX\nk,α\nΨ+\nk,α(ξ(k)ρ3\

    \ ρi’s are Pauli matrices operating on the Nambu spinor space. For simplicity\
    \ we consider here only spin\nsinglet pairing and f as a real function.\nThen\

    \ presence of impurities or foreign atoms is unavoidable. Also, they provide the\
    \ simplest agents of\nquasiparticle relaxation. Therefore the study of impurity\
    \ scattering is crucial to understand quasiparticle transport\nsuch as electric\
    \ conductivity and thermal conductivity.\nIn the early sixties the eﬀect of impurity\
    \ scattering in s-wave superconductivity was systematically studied in\n[76,77,78].\n\
    As is well known, nonmagnetic impurity scattering has little eﬀect in s-wave superconductors.\n\
    The\nsuperconducting transition temperature and the thermodynamics are almost\
    \ unaﬀected. The most dominant eﬀect\nis a reduction of the quasiparticle mean-free\
    \ path, as in the normal state, and its consequence on the magnetic\npenetration\
    \ depth. On the other hand, magnetic impurities have a profound eﬀect on s-wave\
    \ superconductivity. The\nsuperconducting transition temperature is sharply reduced.\
    \ Also in some cases gapless superconductivity is induced\n[78,79].\nIn contrast,\
    \ the nonmagnetic impurities have profound eﬀects on nodal superconductors as\
    \ pointed out in [80,81,82].\nIn particular, resonant impurity scattering appears\
    \ to be prevalent. The extreme limit is the unitary limit where a\nresonance occurs\
    \ at E = 0. Such a model has been discussed for d-wave superconductivity in high-Tc\
    \ cuprates in\n[83,84]. The ﬁrst self-consistent studies of impurity scattering\
    \ in d-wave superconductors were performed in [18,19,20].\nFor simplicity we shall\
    \ limit ourselves to the unitary limit. Also we assume that the impurity is point\
    \ like, i.e. it has\nonly s-wave scattering amplitude. Then the eﬀect of impurity\
    \ scattering can be incorporated by ω →˜ω in Eq. (12)\nwhere ˜ω is the renormalized\
    \ frequency given by [18]\n˜ω = ω −π\n2 Γ\n√\n1 −˜x2\n˜x\n\x12\nK\n\x12\n1\n√\n\

    Note that Eq. (37) is the same as for s-wave superconductors in the presence of\
    \ magnetic impurities [78]. In nodal\nsuperconductors Γ is due to nonmagnetic\

    Surprisingly, ∆(0, Γ)/∆(0, 0) follows very closely Tc/Tc0. Also g(0, Γ) increases\
    \ very rapidly with Γ. This rapid\nincrease in the DOS has been measured by the\
    \ low temperature speciﬁc heat in doped LSCO [85]. Note Cs/(γsT ) =\ng(0). As\
    \ seen from FIG. 8 the experimental data agree very well with the theoretical\
    \ prediction. Especially the\nagreement is almost perfect in the vicinity of the\
    \ optimally doped LSCO. This suggests strongly that the weak-coupling\nBCS theory\
    \ for d-wave superconductivity is adequate for LSCO. We have already mentioned\
    \ that ∆(0)/Tc = 2.14 in\n11\nthe weak-coupling limit. We can deduce this ratio\
    \ for optimally doped LSCO, YBCO and Bi2212. These are 2.15,\n2.64 and 5.3 respectively.\
    \ Indeed LSCO appears to be in the weak-coupling limit whereas YBCO may be in\
    \ the\nintermediate regime. Since the large ratio 5.3 for Bi2212 is rather strange,\

    \ Lee [21] pointed out that the thermal conductivity in d-wave superconductors\
    \ is linear in T for\nT ≪∆(0), and that it takes the universal value κ00/T = k2\n\
    Bvn/(3ℏv2) in the limit Γ →0. A further study indicates\nthat κ/T increases very\
    \ rapidly with Γ, the quasiparticle scattering due to impurities [19]. This result\
    \ was used by\nMay Chiao et al [23,24] to extract ∆(0)/EF of optimally doped Bi2212\
    \ and YBCO. By transforming the expression\nof the thermal conductivity given\
    \ by Ambegaokar and Griﬃn [87], the thermal conductivity for T ≪∆(0) is given\
    \ by\n12\n[19]\nκxx/κn = κyy/κn = Γ\n∆\n\x1C\nC2\n0\n(C2\n0 + f 2)3/2\n\x1D\n\

    \ ∆(0, Γ) have been given in Eq. (33) and Eq. (38) respectively and E(k) is the\
    \ complete elliptic\nintegral of the second kind. For later purposes, it is more\
    \ convenient to normalize κxx by κc\nn, the normal state thermal\nconductivity,\
    \ by Γ = Γc = 0.882Tc0 the critical scattering where superconductivity disappears.\n\
    κc\nn = π2T n\n6Γcm.\n(42)\nThen we can rewrite Eq. (41) as\nκxx/κc\nn = 2Γc\n\

    \ Γ/Γc is shown in Fig. 10.\nWe note that κxx increases monotonically with Γ.\
    \ In other words, the thermal conductivity increases with the\nimpurity scattering.\
    \ This counterintuitive behavior is understood, if one realizes that the impurity\
    \ scattering produces\nquasiparticles due to the pair-breaking eﬀect [19]. Indeed,\
    \ the predicted Γ dependence of κxx was veriﬁed in Zn-doped\nYBCO [22] and more\
    \ recently in Sr2RuO4 [88]. If we substitute in Eq. (41) f = sin(2φ), cos χ, e±iφ\
    \ cos χ, sin χ,\ne±iφ sin χ or cos(2χ), we will obtain the same result. The planar\
    \ thermal conductivity can thus not discriminate\nbetween diﬀerent nodal superconductors\
    \ [89]. The result for the out-of-plane thermal conductivity is of more interest.\n\

    QUASICLASSICAL APPROXIMATION\nA.\nVortex state\nIn the presence of a magnetic\
    \ ﬁeld, all known nodal superconductors enter into the vortex state when the magnetic\n\
    ﬁeld exceeds Hc1(T ), the lower critical ﬁeld.\nIn this vortex state the quantized\
    \ vortex lines form a regular two\ndimensional lattice in the equilibrium conﬁguration.\
    \ Also each vortex line carries a unit ﬂux φ0 = hc/(2e) = 2.06 ·\n10−7Gcm2. The\
    \ marvelous theory of type II superconductivity was created by Abrikosov [93]\
    \ in 1957, based on\nthe phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory [94].\nThe microscopic\
    \ foundation of GL theory was provided by\nGor’kov [95] after the appearance of\
    \ the BCS theory [6]. In s-wave superconductors the vortex lattice is usually\n\
    hexagonal. But in d-wave superconductors the square vortex lattice is more stable\
    \ for T/Tc ≤0.9 [96,97]. Indeed\nthe square vortex lattice was recently observed\
    \ in LSCO by neutron scattering experiments [98].\nAlso unlike in\ns-wave superconductors,\
    \ the quasiparticles dominate the low-temperature transport properties in the\
    \ whole vortex\nstate in nodal superconductors. The quasiclassical approximation\
    \ then provides the most practical way to handle the\nquasiparticle transport\
    \ in the vortex state for T ≪∆.\nB.\nQuasiparticle spectrum in the vortex state\n\
    In 1993 Volovik [54] showed how to calculate the quasiparticle DOS in the vortex\
    \ state of d-wave superconduc-\ntors,when T ≪∆(0). Here we shall follow this procedure.\
    \ First we note that the quasiparticle energy Ek is shifted\nto Ek −v · q = Ek\
    \ −k · vs in the presence of a superﬂow [99]. Here v, 2q and vs are the quasiparticle\
    \ velocity, the\npair momentum and the superﬂuid velocity respectively. Also for\
    \ a class of nodal superconductors we considered in\nSection II, we obtain g(E)\
    \ = |E|/∆for |E| ≪∆.\nIn the presence of a superﬂow this is generalized as\ng(E,\
    \ H) = ∆−1⟨|E −v · q|⟩,\n(47)\nor\ng(0, H) ≡g(H) = ∆−1⟨|v · q|⟩,\n(48)\nwhere\

    \ = 1/\n√\neH and we assumed for simplicity a square vortex lattice with lattice\
    \ constant d. Also, in the present\ncalculation we took q = ˆφ/(2r), where r is\
    \ the distance from the center of a vortex and α is the angle between v and\n\
    q. We treated the average over the vortex lattice `a la Wigner-Seitz. Finally\
    \ in the earlier treatments [60,61,63,64] the\nfactor π−1 coming from (2π)−1 R\
    \ 2π\n0\ndφ δ(cos(2φ)) was missing. From Eq. (49) the speciﬁc heat and other observables\n\
    [100] are obtained as\nCs/γnT = g(H),\nκs/κn = g(H),\nρs(H)\nρs(0) = 1 −g(H).\n\
    (50)\nWe have already mentioned that the\n√\nH dependence of the speciﬁc heat\
    \ in the nodal superconductors was observed\nin YBCO [55,56], LSCO [57] and Sr4RuO4\
    \ [58,59]. However, in the earlier analysis [55,56] a factor ∼0.3 was missing.\n\
    We believe the π−1 we ﬁnd here accounts for this missing factor. In other words,\
    \ the semiclassical result is not only\nqualitatively but also quantitatively\
    \ accurate. It is very easy to work out ⟨|v · q|⟩for other classes of ∆(k) as\
    \ discussed\nin Section II. Then it is easily seen that the conﬁguration H ∥ˆc\
    \ cannot discriminate d-wave superconductors from\nother nodal superconductors.\n\
    C.\nExtension to the arbitrary ﬁeld orientation\nIn order to get a handle on the\
    \ gap symmetry of ∆(k), it is necessary to consider the case of arbitrary ﬁeld\n\
    orientations. For simplicity we limit ourselves to the case where H is in the\
    \ a −b plane with an angle φ from the\na axis. Precisely this conﬁguration is\
    \ considered in [62]. Unfortunately, however, a rather unrealistic Fermi surface\n\
    was considered. Instead we consider the quasi-2D Fermi surface shown in Fig. 12\
    \ [101]. In the present conﬁguration\nthe vortex loses circular symmetry around\
    \ the vortex axis. Therefore we ﬁnd it is very useful to introduce a scale\n16\n\
    transformation as in [102] to make a circular vortex. For f = cos(2φ) we ﬁnd [63]\n\
    g(H) = 2\nπ ˜v\n√\neH\n\x1Cq\nsin2 χ + sin2(φ −φ′)\n\x1D\n≃2\nπ ˜v\n√\neH(0.955\
    \ + 0.0285 cos(4φ)),\n(51)\nwhere ˜v = √vcv and vc is the Fermi velocity parallel\
    \ to the c axis and φ is the angle H makes from the a axis. We\nthus ﬁnd a 3%\
    \ fourfold term (∼cos(4φ)) with a ≤.3% angular variation of g(H) The φ dependence\
    \ of the speciﬁc\nheat in YBCO was studied by Wang et al [103]. They could not\
    \ ﬁnd this small fourfold term which is within their\nexperimental error.\nWhen\
    \ ∆(k) has a horizontal node as in Sr2RuO4 [66] g(H) does not exhibit the φ dependence.\
    \ In particular for\nf = e±iφ cos χ we obtain\n⟨|vq|⟩= 2\nπ2 ˜v\n√\neH\n√\n2E(1/\n\
    √\n2) = 1.216 2\nπ2 ˜v\n√\neH\n(52)\nTherefore the speciﬁc heat of Sr2RuO4 by\
    \ Deguchi et al [104] appears somewhat puzzling. Their data for T > 0.5K is\n\
    consistent with 2D f-wave superconductor. However, something diﬀerent appears\
    \ to happen below T = 0.3K. From\nexperience with YNi2B2C we know sharp cusps\
    \ in g(H) imply point nodes and not line nodes [105]. Therefore the\nspeciﬁc heat\
    \ for T < 0.3K suggests the appearance of point like minigaps for k ∥(1, 0, 0),\
    \ (0, 1, 0) etc. These may be\nreproduced with the secondary energy gap\n∆2(k)\
    \ ∼e±iφ cos χ(1 −a cos(4φ) cos2 χ)\nwith a ≲1. Then the secondary gap has the\
    \ same symmetry as a 2D f-wave superconductor.\nExercises 4.\n4.1. Calculate g(H)\

    \ cos(2χ).\n4.2. Calculate g(H) when H is rotated within the x −y plane. Consider\
    \ the same set of f’s as above.\nVI.\nMAGNETOTHERMAL CONDUCTIVITY\nExperiments\
    \ on the angular dependent thermal conductivity in YBCO [106,107,108,109] indicate\
    \ that the thermal\nconductivity is sensitive to the nodal directions, although\
    \ theoretical interpretation of this data has been given only\nrecently [65].\
    \ In order to calculate the thermal conductivity it is crucial to incorporate\
    \ the eﬀects of impurity scattering\nand of the Doppler shift on an equal footing.\
    \ Then there arise natually two limiting cases: a) the superclean limit\n(Γ∆)1/2\
    \ ≪< |v · q| > and b) the clean limit (Γ∆)1/2 ≫< |v · q| >≫Γ.\nFirst it is necessary\
    \ to determine the quasiparticle lifetime in the presence of impurity scattering\
    \ and the Doppler\nshift. This is given by [63]\nC0 = πΓ\n2∆[< C0 ln(\n2\np\n\
    C2\n0 + x2 ) + x tan−1(x/C0) >]−1\n(53)\nwhere ∆C0 = Im(˜ω) at ω = 0 is the quasi-particle\
    \ relaxation rate on the Fermi surface and x = |v · q|/∆. This\nformula applies\
    \ to the class of f’s introduced in II, which include d-wave superconductivity\
    \ with f = cos(2φ). Also\nin the later analysis we assume that H lies in the ab-plane.\n\
    A.\nSuperclean limit\nIn the superclean limit we can assume that x ≫C0. Then Eq.(52)\
    \ is solved as\nC0 =\nΓ\n∆< x >−1 −2\nπ ( Γ\n∆)2 < x >−3 [ln(2/x) −1]\n(54)\n\
    17\nOn the other hand, in the clean limit we obtain\nC2\n0 ln(2/C0) = πΓ\n2∆−1\n\

    \ was ﬁrst observed in Sr2RuO4 at T = 0.3K [67],\nwhich indicates nodal superconductivity\
    \ with f = e±iφ cos(χ) in Sr2RuO4 and that the system is in the superclean\nlimit.\
    \ More recently the H-linear thermal conductivity was observed in PrOs4Sb12 [71]\
    \ for T ≤0.3K.\nNow in the presence of a magnetic ﬁeld in the a-b plane, we must\
    \ ﬁrst generalize Eq. 57 as [63]\nκxx/κn = π\n4 < x >< (1 + cos(2φ\n′))x >\n(61)\n\
    κyy/κn = π\n4 < x >< (1 −cos(2φ\n′))x >\n(62)\nand\nκxy/κn = π\n4 < x >< sin(2φ\n\
    ′)x >\n(63)\nwhere the angle φ\n′ refers to the direction of the quasiparticle\
    \ wave vector within the a-b plane. Then for f = cos(2φ)\nEq.(58) gives\nκ∥/κn(≡κxx/κn\
    \ = κyy/κn) = ˜v2eH\nπ3∆2 (0.955 + 0.0285 cos(4φ))2\n(64)\nand\nκxy/κn = −˜v2eH\n\
    π3∆2 (0.265 sin(2φ)(0.955 + +0.0285 cos(4φ))\n(65)\nHere ˜v = √vvc. Therefore\
    \ κ∥should exhibit the fourfold term with a magnitude variation of the order of\
    \ ∼6%.\nIn early experiments [106,107,109] a fourfold term of comparative magnitude\
    \ was found in YBCO but of opposite\nsign. Similarly Oca˜na and Esquinazi [108]\
    \ found the Hall thermal conductivity ∼sin(2φ), but of opposite sign. These\n\
    problems were clariﬁed in [65]. All experiments on YBCO were performed at T ≫<\
    \ |v · q| >, whereas the present\ntheory applies only for T ≪< |v · q| >.\nAlso,\
    \ thermal conductivity measurements in CeCoIn5 [68] and κ-(ET)2Cu(NCS)2 [69] have\
    \ seen evidence for a\nfourfold term. If we assume that these experiments are\
    \ done in the region T ≪< |v · q| >, we have to interpret\nthe data as dxy-wave\
    \ superconductivity and dx2−y2 symmetry for CeCoIn5 and κ-(ET)2Cu(NCS)2 respectively.\
    \ The\nformer identiﬁcation appears to be consistent with the magnetospeciﬁc heat\
    \ data of CeCoIn5 reported in [110]. For\nf = e±iφ cos χ, we obtain [64]\nκxx/κn\
    \ = ˜v2(eH)\n∆2\n× 1.479(1 −0.0416 cos(2φ))\n(66)\nThe magnitude of the twofold\
    \ term seen in [66] is consistent with Eq.(66).\n18\nB.\nClean limit\nIn the clean\

    \ κ∥(H →0) and we have assumed H ∥c. In the clean limit the ﬁeld dependence is\
    \ given by κ∥∼\nH ln(H0/H). In a magnetic ﬁeld within the a-b plane we obtain\n\
    κxx/κ0 = 1 +\n1\n6π2 ln\n \n2\nr\n2∆\nπΓ\n!\n˜v2(eH)\nΓ∆\n[ln(\n∆\n˜v\n√\neH\n\

    where we have assumed f = cos(2φ).\nThe b-axis thermal conductivity of κ-(ET)2Cu(NCS)2\
    \ determined by Izawa et al [68] exhibits not only the four-fold\nterm predicted\
    \ in Eq. 65, but also a two-fold term that was not predicted. We can interpret\
    \ the two-fold term\nas being due to the admixture of an s-wave component. The\
    \ experimental data is most naturally interpreted as\n∆(k) ∼cos(2φ) −0.067 [111].\
    \ Finally for T ≫< |v · q| > we obtain [65]\nκxx/κn = 7π2\n10 ( T\n∆)2(1 + ( 2\n\

    VII.\nSUPERCONDUCTIVITY WITH POINT NODES\nA.\nBorocarbides YNi2B2C and LuNi2B2C\n\
    This class of superconductivity was discovered in 1994 [112]. Their relatively\
    \ high transition temperatures (Tc = 15.5\nK and 16.5 K for YNi2B2C and LuNi2B2C,\
    \ respectively) and their interplay between magnetism and superconductivity\n\
    are of great interest. In the following we will focus on the two superconducting\
    \ borocarbides YNi2B2C and LuNi2B2C,\nwhich have no indication of magnetism.\n\
    The presence of a substantial s-wave component in the superconducting order parameter\
    \ ∆(k) in YNi2B2C was\nestablished by substituting Ni by a small amount of Pt.\
    \ An opening of the energy gap was observed by speciﬁc heat\nmeasurements [113].\
    \ On the other hand, this superconductivity exhibits a number of peculiarities\
    \ unexpected for\ns-wave superconductors. For example the\n√\nH dependence of\
    \ the speciﬁc heat in the vortex state [114,115] indicates\na nodal superconductor.\
    \ Furthermore the presence of de-Haas-van-Alphen (dHvA) oscillation in the vortex\
    \ state in\n19\nLuNi2B2C down to H = 0.2Hc2 suggests again nodal superconductivity.[116,117]\
    \ Also T −1\n1\nin NMR exhibits a T 3\npower law consistent with nodal superconductivity\
    \ [118]. In addition ∆(k) exhibits a fourfold symmetry as seen\nfrom the angular\
    \ dependence of the upper critical ﬁeld Hc2 when the magnetic ﬁeld is rotated\
    \ within the a-b plane\n[119,120]. Also, unlike the superconductors discussed\
    \ in previous sections, here we are dealing with a superconductor\nwith a 3D Fermi\
    \ surface.\nThen we postulate [105]\n∆(k) = (∆/2)(1 −sin4(θ) cos(4φ))\n(74)\n\
    where θ and φ are polar coordinates describing k, the quasiparticle wave vector.\
    \ This order parameter belongs to\nthe hybrid representation of s+g-wave superconductivity.\
    \ The precise matching of the s and g-wave components is\nnecessary in order to\
    \ ﬁnd the nodal excitations as observed experimentally. Within a model Hamiltonian\
    \ the stability\nof such a precise matching is considered in [121]. The corresponding\
    \ ∆(k) is shown in Fig. 13. The quasiparticle\ndensity of states is given by\n\

    \ the point nodes here are quadratic which gives N(E) ∼|E| and Cs ∼T 2.\nIn the\

    I(θ, φ) = 1\n2((1 −sin2 θ sin2 φ)1/2 + (1 −sin2 θ cos2 φ)1/2)\n(80)\nHere θ and\
    \ φ are the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld where the polar axis is taken parallel\
    \ to the c axis. We show in\nFig. 15 I(θ, φ). In particular for θ = π/2 the DOS\

    \ al [122.] Unfortunately, however, their data are limited to\nθ = π/2 and cannot\
    \ explore the whole extent of I(θ, φ).\nDue to the presence of an s-wave component,\
    \ the eﬀect of impurity scattering is very diﬀerent from the usual nodal\nsuperconductors\
    \ discussed in III and IV.[123] First of all there is no resonant scattering.\
    \ So the Born approximation\nsuﬃces. Also, unlike in other nodal superconductors\
    \ the energy gap opens up immediately in the presence of impurities.\nThe energy\
    \ gap ωg is given in a good approximation by ωg = Γ(1+ Γ\n∆)−1. Therefore the\
    \ speciﬁc heat and the thermal\nconductivity decrease as T →0 like Cs/T ∼κ/T ∼(ωg/T\
    \ )2e−ωg/T . Hence, there is no universal heat conduction.\nThe gap equation is\

    \ a remnant magnetization in the B phase of this compound indicating triplet pairing.\
    \ Also more\nrecent thermal conductivity data by Izawa et al is not consistent\
    \ with the singlet model [131], but is consistent with\np+h-wave superconductors\
    \ [71]. Finally, Tou et al [133] reported NMR data of PrOs4Sb12 of which the Knight\

    \ Therefore the p-wave superconductivity proposed in [145] is clearly\nout. In\
    \ order to save this situation a multigap model was proposed by Zhitomirsky and\

    VIII.\nD-WAVE DENSITY WAVE\nIn the preceding lectures we have reviewed a variety\
    \ of nodal superconductors which have appeared since 1979.\nFor some of them we\
    \ have succeeded in identifying the gap symmetry. All these analyses are based\
    \ on the BCS\ntheory of nodal superconductors. Also the semiclassical approximation\
    \ played an important part in elucidating the\nquasiparticle properties in the\
    \ vortex state.\nTherefore it is very natural to contemplate a parallel development\
    \ in charge density wave (CDW) and spin density\nwave [2,153] systems The unconventional\
    \ density wave (UDW) was speculated as a possible electronic ground state\nin\
    \ excitonic insulators in 1968 [154]. However, the recent surge of interest in\
    \ UDW is in part due to the proposal\nthat the pseudogap phase in high-Tc cuprate\
    \ superconductors is a d-wave density wave (d-DW).[43,44,45,46] It is\nimportant\
    \ to point out that two kinds of d-DW have been considered. The ﬁrst one is commensurate\
    \ and individual\nsquare lattice enclosing a circulating current [43,45] analogous\
    \ to the ﬂux phase [47]. Therefore the ground state has\nZ2 symmetry and “visons”\
    \ as topological defects. [48] On the other hand we consider a d-DW, which is\
    \ in general\nincommensurate. [46] Therefore as in a superconductor the ground\
    \ state has U(1) symmetry associated with the axial\ngauge transformation\nc†\n\
    k →eiφ/2c†\nk,\nc†\nk+Q →e−iφ/2c†\nk+Q\n(101)\nThe d-DW can have “phase vortices”\
    \ similar to the ones in conventional CDW [49].\nHere are a few characteristics\
    \ of unconventional density waves (UDW) [155]. First of all, the transition from\
    \ the\nnormal state to UDW is a metal-to-metal transition. Though the quasiparticle\
    \ density decreases due to the opening\nof a partial energy gap, UDW are conductors\
    \ down to T = 0 K. In high-Tc cuprates the resistivity ∼T 2 in the\nnormal state\
    \ changes to the resistivity ∼T for example. Also, we shall see that the quasiparticles\
    \ in UDW are a\nstandard Fermi liquid. Therefore this anomalous resistivity behavior\
    \ does not imply the existence of a “non-Fermi\nliquid”. Since ⟨∆(k)⟩=0, there\
    \ will be no x-ray or neutron signal for charge density or spin density. Therefore\
    \ UDW\nis sometimes called a condensate with a hidden order parameter [45].\n\
    The quasiparticle Green function in UDW is given by\nG−1(k, ω) = ω −η(k) −ξ\n\
    ′(k)ρ3 −∆(k)ρ1\n(102)\nwhere ξ\n′(k) = 1\n2(ξ(k) −ξ(k −Q)), η(k) = 1\n2(ξ(k) +\
    \ ξ(k + q)) and Q is the nesting vector. Also the ρ′s are the Pauli\nmatrices\
    \ operating on the spinor space made of |c†\nk⟩and |c†\nk−Q⟩. Here we consider\
    \ only UCDW for simplicity and\nspin indices are dropped. In the following we\
    \ drop the prime for ξ\n′(k), since there will be no confusion. Then the\nquasi-particle\
    \ energy is given by\nω = η(k) ±\np\nξ2(k) + ∆2(k)\n(103)\nwhich is identical\
    \ to that for nodal superconductors except for η(k), the imperfect nesting term.\n\
    Here are two urgent questions:\nWhere can we ﬁnd UDW? If they exist, how can we\
    \ identify them? As to the second question, we believe that two\nhallmarks of\
    \ UDW are the angle-dependent magnetoresistance and the giant Nernst eﬀect [155].\
    \ Both of these are\nconsequences of the Landau quantization of the quasiparticle\
    \ spectrum in UDW or Nersesyan’s eﬀect.[156,157]\nA.\nThe Nersesyan eﬀect\nIn\
    \ 1989 Nersesyan et al pointed out that the quasiparticle motion in UDW is quantized\
    \ in the presence of a magnetic\nﬁeld perpendicular to the conducting plane. Then\
    \ the QP spectrum becomes\nE±\nn = η ±\np\n2nvv2e|B cos θ|\n(104)\n27\nwhere n=0,1,2,3...\
    \ and the n ̸= 0 states are doubly degenerate and v2/v = ∆/EF [158]. Here ∆is\
    \ the maximal energy\ngap in UDW and we assumed η (the chemical potential) independent\
    \ of k. First the magnetoresistance is given by\nR(B, θ)−1 = 2σo + 4σ1\n\x12 e−x1\
    \ + cosh(ξ0)\ncosh x1 + cosh ξ0\n\x13\n(105)\nwhere x1 = β\np\n2evv2|B cos θ|,\
    \ ξ0 = βη and β = 1/kBT . Here we considered only the 2 lowest Landau levels.\
    \ A\nslight modiﬁcation of this simple formula can describe the low-temperature\
    \ phase of α-(ET)2KHg(SCN)4 [159] and\nthe metallic phase in the Bechgaard salts\
    \ [160,161]. See Fig. 23. Second, in the presence of an electric ﬁeld the QP\n\
    FIG. 23: Phase diagrams for low-temperature phase of α-(ET)2KHg(SCN)4 [159](left)\
    \ and the metallic phase in the Bechgaard\nsalts(right)\norbits drift with vD\
    \ = (E×B)/|B|2. This gives rise to a large negative Nernst eﬀect [158]. We obtain\n\
    αxy = −SR\nB = 2eR(ln 2 + 2 ln(2 cosh(x1/2)) −x1 tanh(x1/2))\n(106)\nwhere S is\
    \ the entropy associated with the QPs.\nIndeed a large negative Nernst eﬀect has\
    \ been observed in α-\n(ET)2KHg(SCN)4 [162], in the pseudogap region of high-Tc\
    \ cuprates [163,164,165], in the CDW region of NbSe2 [166]\nand more recently\
    \ in CeCoIn5[167,168]. Recently we have analyzed the Nernst coeﬃcient observed\
    \ in CeCoIn5 [168]\nin terms of Eq. 105. This is shown in Fig 24 a) and b). We\
    \ obtain an excellent ﬁt as is seen readily. On the other\nhand, in order to describe\
    \ the temperature dependence we have to assume\n∆(T )v(T ) = a + bT 4\n(107)\n\
    whose origin is unclear. However, it is possible that the above temperature dependence\
    \ indicates the presence of a\nquantum critical point (QCP) in CeCoIn5.\nIn addition,\
    \ we have shown recently the giant Nernst eﬀect observed in the underdoped region\
    \ of YBCO, LSCO and\nBi-2212 [163,165] are described in terms of dDW [169]. Very\
    \ recently a similar but positive giant Nernst eﬀect has\nbeen reported in the\
    \ AF phase in URu2Si2 [170]. Indeed there has been a suggestion that CDW in NbSe2\
    \ is UCDW\n[171] and the AF phase in URu2Si2 is USDW [172,173]. So far we have\
    \ identiﬁed 7 candidates for UDW which include\nthe 3 high-Tc cuprate superconductors\
    \ YBCO, LSCO and Bi-2212 in the underdoped region.\nComing back to high-Tc cuprates,\
    \ 1) ∆(k) = ∆cos(2φ) in the pseudogap region is determined by ARPES [174].\n2)\
    \ The similar phase diagram as in Fig. 2 is obtained when T is replaced by the\
    \ low-temperature energy gap which\nis measured by STM [175,176], ARPES [14,177]\
    \ and the universal heat conduction [178]. In particular, if one puts\n∆= 2.14T\
    \ ∗these two phase diagrams match almost perfectly. Needless to say, ∆/Tc = 2.14\
    \ is also valid for d-wave\ndensity wave in the weak-coupling limit when |η| ≪∆[17,74].\n\
    IX.\nGOSSAMER SUPERCONDUCTIVITY\nIn the ﬁrst lecture we discussed Laughlin’s critique\
    \ [51] on Anderson’s RVB state (Eq.(2)). The new wave function\nsuggested by Laughlin\
    \ can be interpreted as d-wave superconductor in the presence of another order\
    \ parameter [52,53].\nFrom the phase diagram for high-Tc cuprates, the most relevent\
    \ state is a d-wave superconductor in the presence\n28\nFIG. 24: The magnetic\
    \ ﬁeld dependence of the Nernst coeﬃcient is plotted for (left) T = 1.3 K, 1.65\
    \ K, 2.5 K, 3.5 K and 4.8\nK from top to bottom, and for (right) T = 7.3 K, 10.5\
    \ K and 15 K from bottom to top. The circles denote the experimental\ndata, while\
    \ the solid line is our ﬁt.\nof d-wave density wave. Also this is the prevailing\
    \ feature in heavy-fermion systems like URu2Si2, CeCu2Si2 [179],\nCeCoIn5, CeRhIn5,\
    \ UPd2Al3, and organic conductors like κ −(ET )2 salts [180,181,182].\nComing\
    \ back to high-Tc cuprate superconductors, ∆(k) for d-DW can be readily identiﬁed\
    \ as the order parameter\nphenomenologically introduced by Tallon and Loram [50].\n\
    For example, the superﬂuid density in the gossamer\nsuperconductor at T=0 K is\
    \ given by\nρs(0, η) =\n∆2\n1(0)\n∆2\n2(0) + ∆2\n1(0)\n(108)\nwhile the c-axis\
    \ superﬂuid density is\nρs,c(0, η) =\n∆2\n1(0)\np\n∆2\n2(0) + ∆2\n1(0)\n(109)\n\
    where ∆1(0) and ∆2(0) are the maximal gaps of d-wave superconductor and d-wave\
    \ density wave, respectively, at T=\n0 K.\nIt is of great interest to explore\
    \ a variety of transport properties in the gossamer superconductivity. For example,\n\
    if η, the chemical potential is negligible (|η| ≪T ), we obtain again the universal\
    \ heat conduction (Eq.(3)) where now\n∆=\np\n∆2\n1 + ∆2\n2. Also, ARPES would\
    \ see the energy gap [174]\n∆(k) =\nq\n(∆2 cos(2φ) −η)2 + ∆2\n1 cos2(2φ)\n(110)\n\
    ≃|∆cos(2φ) −η|\n(111)\nIf you look carefully at the phase diagram of Bi-2212 (see\
    \ for example [177]), unlike LSCO and YBCO the supercon-\nducting dome in Bi-2212\
    \ is completely covered by the pseudogap phase. This suggests that the superconductivity\
    \ in\nBi-2212 is gossamer for the whole doping range. This may be one of the reasons\
    \ why ∆(0)/Tc ∼5 in Bi-2212 is so\nlarge. In this sense the systematic study of\
    \ the optical conductivity, the Raman spectra and the thermal conductivity\n(with\
    \ special attention to the doping dependence of these quantities) is of great\
    \ interest.\nIn summary, in exploring unconventional or nodal superconductors,\
    \ we have encountered a vast forest inhabited by\nmany unconventional density\
    \ wave (UDW) and gossamer superconductors where these two order parameters coexist.\n\
    Surprisingly, all of these ground states have been expected from the infrared\
    \ instability of the 2D and 3D Fermi liquid.\nTherefore we can restore the legacy\
    \ of Landau’s Fermi liquid theory and BCS theory of superconductivity in a proper\n\
    perspective. Then armed with the Green function methodology as in Abrikosov, Gor’kov\
    \ and Dzyaloshinski (AGD)\n[183] we will be fully prepared to explore the plethora\
    \ of new ground states.\nAcknowledgments\nWe have beneﬁtted from close collaboration\

  - 'Seven distinct families of superconductors with critical temperatures at

    ambient pressure that equal or surpass the historic 23 K limit for Nb3Ge have

    been discovered in the last 25 years. Each family is reviewed briefly and their

    common chemical features are discussed. High temperature superconductors are

    distinguished by having a high (\geq 50%) content of nonmetallic elements and

    fall into two broad classes. ''Metal-nonmetal'' superconductors require a

    specific combination of elements such as Cu-O and Fe-As which give rise to the

    highest known Tc''s, probably through a magnetic pairing mechanism.

    ''Nonmetal-bonded'' materials contain covalently-bonded nonmetal anion networks

    and are BCS-like superconductors. Fitting an extreme value function to the

    distribution of Tc values for the known high-Tc families suggests that the

    probability of a newly discovered superconductor family having maximum Tc > 100

    K is ~0.1-1%, decreasing to ~0.02-0.2% for room temperature superconductivity.'

  - superconductor | one of my child genius ideas at around 7 years of age (without
    any prior knowledge of any of this) was of a perpetually propelled train by the
    use of magnets of consecutive opposite polarities on the track and train. this
    borders with the (currently) pseudoscience concept of perpetuum mobile but through
    means of electrically interchanging the polarity of each consecutive magnet it
    might not be as unrealistic to use for the gradual propelling of the train. as

  - "In superconductivity, a fluxon (also called an Abrikosov vortex or quantum vortex)\
    \ is a vortex of supercurrent in a type-II superconductor, used by Soviet physicist\

  - "Superconductivity is a set of physical properties observed in superconductors:\
    \ materials where electrical resistance vanishes and magnetic fields are expelled\
    \ from the material. Unlike an ordinary metallic conductor, whose resistance decreases\
    \ gradually as its temperature is lowered, even down to near absolute zero, a\
    \ superconductor has a characteristic critical temperature below which the resistance\
    \ drops abruptly to zero. An electric current through a loop of superconducting\
    \ wire can persist indefinitely with no power source.\nThe superconductivity phenomenon\
    \ was discovered in 1911 by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes. Like ferromagnetism\
    \ and atomic spectral lines, superconductivity is a phenomenon which can only\
    \ be explained by quantum mechanics. It is characterized by the Meissner effect,\
    \ the complete cancellation of the magnetic field in the interior of the superconductor\
    \ during its transitions into the superconducting state. The occurrence of the\
    \ Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity cannot be understood simply\
    \ as the idealization of perfect conductivity in classical physics.\nIn 1986,\
    \ it was discovered that some cuprate-perovskite ceramic materials have a critical\
    \ temperature above 35 K (−238 °C). It was shortly found (by Ching-Wu Chu) that\
    \ replacing the lanthanum with yttrium, i.e. making YBCO, raised the critical\
    \ temperature to 92 K (−181 °C), which was important because liquid nitrogen could\
    \ then be used as a refrigerant. Such a high transition temperature is theoretically\
    \ impossible for a conventional superconductor, leading the materials to be termed\
    \ high-temperature superconductors. The cheaply available coolant liquid nitrogen\
    \ boils at 77 K (−196 °C) and thus the existence of superconductivity at higher\
    \ temperatures than this facilitates many experiments and applications that are\
    \ less practical at lower temperatures.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSuperconductivity\
    \ was discovered on April 8, 1911, by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, who was studying\
    \ the resistance of solid mercury at cryogenic temperatures using the recently\
    \ produced liquid helium as a refrigerant. At the temperature of 4.2 K, he observed\
    \ that the resistance abruptly disappeared. In the same experiment, he also observed\
    \ the superfluid transition of helium at 2.2 K, without recognizing its significance.\
    \ The precise date and circumstances of the discovery were only reconstructed\
    \ a century later, when Onnes's notebook was found. In subsequent decades, superconductivity\
    \ was observed in several other materials. In 1913, lead was found to superconduct\
    \ at 7 K, and in 1941 niobium nitride was found to superconduct at 16 K.\nGreat\
    \ efforts have been devoted to finding out how and why superconductivity works;\
    \ the important step occurred in 1933, when Meissner and Ochsenfeld discovered\
    \ that superconductors expelled applied magnetic fields, a phenomenon which has\
    \ come to be known as the Meissner effect. In 1935, Fritz and Heinz London showed\
    \ that the Meissner effect was a consequence of the minimization of the electromagnetic\
    \ free energy carried by superconducting current.\n\n\n=== London constitutive\
    \ equations ===\nThe theoretical model that was first conceived for superconductivity\
    \ was completely classical: it is summarized by London constitutive equations.\
    \ It was put forward by the brothers Fritz and Heinz London in 1935, shortly after\
    \ the discovery that magnetic fields are expelled from superconductors. A major\
    \ triumph of the equations of this theory is their ability to explain the Meissner\
    \ effect, wherein a material exponentially expels all internal magnetic fields\
    \ as it crosses the superconducting threshold. By using the London equation, one\
    \ can obtain the dependence of the magnetic field inside the superconductor on\
    \ the distance to the surface.\nThe two constitutive equations for a superconductor\
    \ by London are:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n   \

    \ .}\n  \n\nThe first equation follows from Newton's second law for superconducting\
    \ electrons.\n\n\n=== Conventional theories (1950s) ===\nDuring the 1950s, theoretical\
    \ condensed matter physicists arrived at an understanding of \"conventional\"\
    \ superconductivity, through a pair of remarkable and important theories: the\
    \ phenomenological Ginzburg–Landau theory (1950) and the microscopic BCS theory\
    \ (1957).\nIn 1950, the phenomenological Ginzburg–Landau theory of superconductivity\
    \ was devised by Landau and Ginzburg. This theory, which combined Landau's theory\
    \ of second-order phase transitions with a Schrödinger-like wave equation, had\
    \ great success in explaining the macroscopic properties of superconductors. In\
    \ particular, Abrikosov showed that Ginzburg–Landau theory predicts the division\
    \ of superconductors into the two categories now referred to as Type I and Type\
    \ II. Abrikosov and Ginzburg were awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize for their work\
    \ (Landau had received the 1962 Nobel Prize for other work, and died in 1968).\
    \ The four-dimensional extension of the Ginzburg–Landau theory, the Coleman-Weinberg\
    \ model, is important in quantum field theory and cosmology.\nAlso in 1950, Maxwell\
    \ and Reynolds et al. found that the critical temperature of a superconductor\
    \ depends on the isotopic mass of the constituent element. This important discovery\
    \ pointed to the electron–phonon interaction as the microscopic mechanism responsible\
    \ for superconductivity.\nThe complete microscopic theory of superconductivity\
    \ was finally proposed in 1957 by Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer. This BCS theory\
    \ explained the superconducting current as a superfluid of Cooper pairs, pairs\
    \ of electrons interacting through the exchange of phonons. For this work, the\
    \ authors were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1972.\nThe BCS theory was set on a firmer\
    \ footing in 1958, when N. N. Bogolyubov showed that the BCS wavefunction, which\
    \ had originally been derived from a variational argument, could be obtained using\
    \ a canonical transformation of the electronic Hamiltonian. In 1959, Lev Gor'kov\
    \ showed that the BCS theory reduced to the Ginzburg–Landau theory close to the\
    \ critical temperature.\nGeneralizations of BCS theory for conventional superconductors\
    \ form the basis for the understanding of the phenomenon of superfluidity, because\
    \ they fall into the lambda transition universality class. The extent to which\
    \ such generalizations can be applied to unconventional superconductors is still\
    \ controversial.\n\n\n=== Niobium ===\nThe first practical application of superconductivity\
    \ was developed in 1954 with Dudley Allen Buck's invention of the cryotron. Two\
    \ superconductors with greatly different values of the critical magnetic field\
    \ are combined to produce a fast, simple switch for computer elements.\nSoon after\
    \ discovering superconductivity in 1911, Kamerlingh Onnes attempted to make an\
    \ electromagnet with superconducting windings but found that relatively low magnetic\
    \ fields destroyed superconductivity in the materials he investigated. Much later,\
    \ in 1955, G. B. Yntema succeeded in constructing a small 0.7-tesla iron-core\
    \ electromagnet with superconducting niobium wire windings. Then, in 1961, J.\
    \ E. Kunzler, E. Buehler, F. S. L. Hsu, and J. H. Wernick made the startling discovery\
    \ that, at 4.2 kelvin, niobium–tin, a compound consisting of three parts niobium\
    \ and one part tin, was capable of supporting a current density of more than 100,000\
    \ amperes per square centimeter in a magnetic field of 8.8 tesla. The alloy was\
    \ brittle and difficult to fabricate, but niobium–tin proved useful for generating\
    \ magnetic fields as high as 20 tesla.\nIn 1962, T. G. Berlincourt and R. R. Hake\
    \ discovered that more ductile alloys of niobium and titanium are suitable for\
    \ applications up to 10 tesla. Commercial production of niobium–titanium supermagnet\
    \ wire immediately commenced at Westinghouse Electric Corporation and at Wah Chang\
    \ Corporation. Although niobium–titanium boasts less-impressive superconducting\
    \ properties than those of niobium–tin, niobium–titanium became the most widely\
    \ used \"workhorse\" supermagnet material, in large measure a consequence of its\
    \ very high ductility and ease of fabrication. However, both niobium–tin and niobium–titanium\
    \ found wide application in MRI medical imagers, bending and focusing magnets\
    \ for enormous high-energy-particle accelerators, and other applications. Conectus,\
    \ a European superconductivity consortium, estimated that in 2014, global economic\
    \ activity for which superconductivity was indispensable amounted to about five\
    \ billion euros, with MRI systems accounting for about 80% of that total.\n\n\n\
    === Josephson effect ===\nIn 1962, Josephson made the important theoretical prediction\
    \ that a supercurrent can flow between two pieces of superconductor separated\
    \ by a thin layer of insulator. This phenomenon, now called the Josephson effect,\
    \ is exploited by superconducting devices such as SQUIDs. It is used in the most\
    \ accurate available measurements of the magnetic flux quantum Φ0 = h/(2e), where\
    \ h is the Planck constant. Coupled with the quantum Hall resistivity, this leads\
    \ to a precise measurement of the Planck constant. Josephson was awarded the Nobel\
    \ Prize for this work in 1973.\nIn 2008, it was proposed that the same mechanism\
    \ that produces superconductivity could produce a superinsulator state in some\
    \ materials, with almost infinite electrical resistance. The first development\
    \ and study of superconducting Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) in 2020 suggested\
    \ a \"smooth transition between\" BEC and Bardeen-Cooper-Shrieffer regimes.\n\n\
    \n=== 2D materials ===\nMultiple types of superconductivity are reported in devices\
    \ made of single-layer materials. Some of these materials can switch between conducting,\
    \ insulating, and other behaviors.\nTwisting materials imbues them with a \"moiré\"\
    \ pattern involving tiled hexagonal cells that act like atoms and host electrons.\
    \ In this environment, the electrons move slowly enough for their collective interactions\
    \ to guide their behavior. When each cell has a single electron, the electrons\
    \ take on an antiferromagnetic arrangement; each electron can have a preferred\
    \ location and magnetic orientation. Their intrinsic magnetic fields tend to alternate\
    \ between pointing up and down. Adding electrons allows superconductivity by causing\
    \ Cooper pairs to form. Fu and Schrade argued that electron-on-electron action\
    \ was allowing both antiferromagnetic and superconducting states.\nThe first success\
    \ with 2D materials involved a twisted bilayer graphene sheet (2018, Tc ~1.7 K,\
    \ 1.1° twist). A twisted three-layer graphene device was later shown to superconduct\
    \ (2021, Tc ~2.8 K). Then an untwisted trilayer graphene device was reported to\
    \ superconduct (2022, Tc 1-2 K). The latter was later shown to be tunable, easily\
    \ reproducing behavior found in millions of other configurations. Directly observing\
    \ what happens when electrons are added to a material or slightly weakening its\
    \ electric field enables quick testing of an unprecedented number of recipes to\
    \ see which lead to superconductivity.\nIn four and five layer rhombohedral graphene,\
    \ a form of superconductivity with spontaneously broken time reversal symmetry\
    \ known as \"chiral superconductivity\" was recently observed. These systems were\
    \ not observed to have any superlattice effects, and they can flip between two\
    \ possible magnetic states without exiting the superconducting phase. This is\
    \ in strong contrast to other observations of superconductivity and magnetic fields.\
    \ \nThese devices have applications in quantum computing.\n2D materials other\
    \ than graphene have also been made to superconduct. Transition metal dichalcogenide\
    \ (TMD) sheets twisted at 5 degrees intermittently achieved superconduction by\
    \ creating a Josephson junction. The device used used thin layers of palladium\
    \ to connect to the sides of a tungsten telluride layer surrounded and protected\
    \ by boron nitride. Another group demonstrated superconduction in molybdenum telluride\
    \ (MoTe₂) in 2D van der Waals materials using ferroelectric domain walls. The\
    \ Tc was implied to be higher than typical TMDs (~5–10 K).\nA Cornell group added\
    \ a 3.5-degree twist to an insulator that allowed electrons to slow down and interact\
    \ strongly, leaving one electron per cell, exhibiting superconduction. Existing\
    \ theories do not explain this behavior.\nFu and collaborators proposed that electrons\
    \ arrange to form a repeating crystal that allows the electron grid to float independently\
    \ of the background atomic nuclei and the electron grid to relax. Its ripples\
    \ pair electrons the way phonons do, although this is unconfirmed.\n\n\n== Classification\
    \ ==\n\nSuperconductors are classified according to many criteria. The most common\
    \ are:\n\n\n=== Response to a magnetic field ===\nA superconductor can be Type\
    \ I, meaning it has a single critical field, above which superconductivity is\
    \ lost and below which the magnetic field is completely expelled from the superconductor;\
    \ or Type II, meaning it has two critical fields, between which it allows partial\
    \ penetration of the magnetic field through isolated points called vortices. Furthermore,\
    \ in multicomponent superconductors it is possible to combine the two behaviours.\
    \ In that case the superconductor is of Type-1.5.\n\n\n=== Theory of operation\
    \ ===\nA superconductor is conventional if it is driven by electron–phonon interaction\
    \ and explained by the BCS theory or its extension, the Eliashberg theory. Otherwise,\
    \ it is unconventional. Alternatively, a superconductor is called unconventional\
    \ if the superconducting order parameter transforms according to a non-trivial\
    \ irreducible representation of the system's point group or space group.\n\n\n\
    === Critical temperature ===\nA superconductor is generally considered high-temperature\
    \ if it reaches a superconducting state above a temperature of 30 K (−243.15 °C);\
    \ as in the initial discovery by Georg Bednorz and K. Alex Müller. It may also\
    \ reference materials that transition to superconductivity when cooled using liquid\
    \ nitrogen – that is, at only Tc > 77 K, although this is generally used only\
    \ to emphasize that liquid nitrogen coolant is sufficient. Low temperature superconductors\
    \ refer to materials with a critical temperature below 30 K, and are cooled mainly\
    \ by liquid helium (Tc > 4.2 K). One exception to this rule is the iron pnictide\
    \ group of superconductors that display behaviour and properties typical of high-temperature\
    \ superconductors, yet some of the group have critical temperatures below 30 K.\n\
    \n\n=== Material ===\n\nSuperconductor material classes include chemical elements\
    \ (e.g. mercury or lead), alloys (such as niobium–titanium, germanium–niobium,\
    \ and niobium nitride), ceramics (YBCO and magnesium diboride), superconducting\
    \ pnictides (like fluorine-doped LaOFeAs), single-layer materials such as graphene\
    \ and transition metal dichalcogenides, or organic superconductors (fullerenes\
    \ and carbon nanotubes; though perhaps these examples should be included among\
    \ the chemical elements, as they are composed entirely of carbon).\n\n\n== Elementary\
    \ properties ==\n\nSeveral physical properties of superconductors vary from material\
    \ to material, such as the critical temperature, the value of the superconducting\
    \ gap, the critical magnetic field, and the critical current density at which\
    \ superconductivity is destroyed. On the other hand, there is a class of properties\
    \ that are independent of the underlying material. The Meissner effect, the quantization\
    \ of the magnetic flux or permanent currents, i.e. the state of zero resistance\
    \ are the most important examples. The existence of these \"universal\" properties\
    \ is rooted in the nature of the broken symmetry of the superconductor and the\
    \ emergence of off-diagonal long range order. Superconductivity is a thermodynamic\
    \ phase, and thus possesses certain distinguishing properties which are largely\
    \ independent of microscopic details. Off diagonal long range order is closely\
    \ connected to the formation of Cooper pairs.\n\n\n=== Zero electrical DC resistance\
    \ ===\n\nThe simplest method to measure the electrical resistance of a sample\
    \ of some material is to place it in an electrical circuit in series with a current\
    \ source I and measure the resulting voltage V across the sample. The resistance\
    \ of the sample is given by Ohm's law as R = V / I. If the voltage is zero, this\
    \ means that the resistance is zero.\nSuperconductors are also able to maintain\
    \ a current with no applied voltage whatsoever, a property exploited in superconducting\
    \ electromagnets such as those found in MRI machines. Experiments have demonstrated\
    \ that currents in superconducting coils can persist for years without any measurable\
    \ degradation. Experimental evidence points to a lifetime of at least 100,000\
    \ years. Theoretical estimates for the lifetime of a persistent current can exceed\
    \ the estimated lifetime of the universe, depending on the wire geometry and the\
    \ temperature. In practice, currents injected in superconducting coils persisted\
    \ for 28 years, 7 months, 27 days in a superconducting gravimeter in Belgium,\
    \ from August 4, 1995 until March 31, 2024. In such instruments, the measurement\
    \ is based on the monitoring of the levitation of a superconducting niobium sphere\
    \ with a mass of four grams.\nIn a normal conductor, an electric current may be\
    \ visualized as a fluid of electrons moving across a heavy ionic lattice. The\
    \ electrons are constantly colliding with the ions in the lattice, and during\
    \ each collision some of the energy carried by the current is absorbed by the\
    \ lattice and converted into heat, which is essentially the vibrational kinetic\
    \ energy of the lattice ions. As a result, the energy carried by the current is\
    \ constantly being dissipated. This is the phenomenon of electrical resistance\
    \ and Joule heating.\nThe situation is different in a superconductor. In a conventional\
    \ superconductor, the electronic fluid cannot be resolved into individual electrons.\
    \ Instead, it consists of bound pairs of electrons known as Cooper pairs. This\
    \ pairing is caused by an attractive force between electrons from the exchange\
    \ of phonons. This pairing is very weak, and small thermal vibrations can fracture\
    \ the bond. Due to quantum mechanics, the energy spectrum of this Cooper pair\
    \ fluid possesses an energy gap, meaning there is a minimum amount of energy ΔE\
    \ that must be supplied in order to excite the fluid. Therefore, if ΔE is larger\
    \ than the thermal energy of the lattice, given by kT, where k is the Boltzmann\
    \ constant and T is the temperature, the fluid will not be scattered by the lattice.\
    \ The Cooper pair fluid is thus a superfluid, meaning it can flow without energy\
    \ dissipation.\nIn the class of superconductors known as type II superconductors,\
    \ including all known high-temperature superconductors, an extremely low but non-zero\
    \ resistivity appears at temperatures not too far below the nominal superconducting\
    \ transition when an electric current is applied in conjunction with a strong\
    \ magnetic field, which may be caused by the electric current. This is due to\
    \ the motion of magnetic vortices in the electronic superfluid, which dissipates\
    \ some of the energy carried by the current. If the current is sufficiently small,\
    \ the vortices are stationary, and the resistivity vanishes. The resistance due\
    \ to this effect is minuscule compared with that of non-superconducting materials,\
    \ but must be taken into account in sensitive experiments. However, as the temperature\
    \ decreases far enough below the nominal superconducting transition, these vortices\
    \ can become frozen into a disordered but stationary phase known as a \"vortex\
    \ glass\". Below this vortex glass transition temperature, the resistance of the\
    \ material becomes truly zero.\n\n\n=== Phase transition ===\n\nIn superconducting\
    \ materials, the characteristics of superconductivity appear when the temperature\
    \ T is lowered below a critical temperature Tc. The value of this critical temperature\
    \ varies from material to material. Conventional superconductors usually have\
    \ critical temperatures ranging from around 20 K to less than 1 K. Solid mercury,\
    \ for example, has a critical temperature of 4.2 K. As of 2015, the highest critical\
    \ temperature found for a conventional superconductor is 203 K for H2S, although\
    \ high pressures of approximately 90 gigapascals were required. Cuprate superconductors\
    \ can have much higher critical temperatures: YBa2Cu3O7, one of the first cuprate\
    \ superconductors to be discovered, has a critical temperature above 90 K, and\
    \ mercury-based cuprates have been found with critical temperatures in excess\
    \ of 130 K. The basic physical mechanism responsible for the high critical temperature\
    \ is not yet clear. However, it is clear that a two-electron pairing is involved,\
    \ although the nature of the pairing (\n  \n    \n      \n        s\n      \n\
    \    \n    {\\displaystyle s}\n  \n wave vs. \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n \
    \     \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d}\n  \n wave) remains controversial.\nSimilarly,\
    \ at a fixed temperature below the critical temperature, superconducting materials\
    \ cease to superconduct when an external magnetic field is applied which is greater\
    \ than the critical magnetic field. This is because the Gibbs free energy of the\
    \ superconducting phase increases quadratically with the magnetic field while\
    \ the free energy of the normal phase is roughly independent of the magnetic field.\
    \ If the material superconducts in the absence of a field, then the superconducting\
    \ phase free energy is lower than that of the normal phase and so for some finite\
    \ value of the magnetic field (proportional to the square root of the difference\
    \ of the free energies at zero magnetic field) the two free energies will be equal\
    \ and a phase transition to the normal phase will occur. More generally, a higher\
    \ temperature and a stronger magnetic field lead to a smaller fraction of electrons\
    \ that are superconducting and consequently to a longer London penetration depth\
    \ of external magnetic fields and currents. The penetration depth becomes infinite\
    \ at the phase transition.\nThe onset of superconductivity is accompanied by abrupt\
    \ changes in various physical properties, which is the hallmark of a phase transition.\
    \ For example, the electronic heat capacity is proportional to the temperature\
    \ in the normal (non-superconducting) regime. At the superconducting transition,\
    \ it suffers a discontinuous jump and thereafter ceases to be linear. At low temperatures,\
    \ it varies instead as e−α/T for some constant, α. This exponential behavior is\
    \ one of the pieces of evidence for the existence of the energy gap.\nThe order\
    \ of the superconducting phase transition was long a matter of debate. Experiments\
    \ indicate that the transition is second-order, meaning there is no latent heat.\
    \ However, in the presence of an external magnetic field there is latent heat,\
    \ because the superconducting phase has a lower entropy below the critical temperature\
    \ than the normal phase. It has been experimentally demonstrated that, as a consequence,\
    \ when the magnetic field is increased beyond the critical field, the resulting\
    \ phase transition leads to a decrease in the temperature of the superconducting\
    \ material.\nCalculations in the 1970s suggested that it may actually be weakly\
    \ first-order due to the effect of long-range fluctuations in the electromagnetic\
    \ field. In the 1980s it was shown theoretically with the help of a disorder field\
    \ theory, in which the vortex lines of the superconductor play a major role, that\
    \ the transition is of second order within the type II regime and of first order\
    \ (i.e., latent heat) within the type I regime, and that the two regions are separated\
    \ by a tricritical point. The results were strongly supported by Monte Carlo computer\
    \ simulations.\n\n\n=== Meissner effect ===\n\nWhen a superconductor is placed\
    \ in a weak external magnetic field H, and cooled below its transition temperature,\
    \ the magnetic field is ejected. The Meissner effect does not cause the field\
    \ to be completely ejected but instead, the field penetrates the superconductor\
    \ but only to a very small distance, characterized by a parameter λ, called the\
    \ London penetration depth, decaying exponentially to zero within the bulk of\
    \ the material. The Meissner effect is a defining characteristic of superconductivity.\
    \ For most superconductors, the London penetration depth is on the order of 100\
    \ nm.\nThe Meissner effect is sometimes confused with the kind of diamagnetism\
    \ one would expect in a perfect electrical conductor: according to Lenz's law,\
    \ when a changing magnetic field is applied to a conductor, it will induce an\
    \ electric current in the conductor that creates an opposing magnetic field. In\
    \ a perfect conductor, an arbitrarily large current can be induced, and the resulting\
    \ magnetic field exactly cancels the applied field.\nThe Meissner effect is distinct\
    \ from this – it is the spontaneous expulsion that occurs during transition to\
    \ superconductivity. Suppose we have a material in its normal state, containing\
    \ a constant internal magnetic field. When the material is cooled below the critical\
    \ temperature, we would observe the abrupt expulsion of the internal magnetic\
    \ field, which we would not expect based on Lenz's law.\nThe Meissner effect was\
    \ given a phenomenological explanation by the brothers Fritz and Heinz London,\
    \ who showed that the electromagnetic free energy in a superconductor is minimized\
    \ provided \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∇\n          \n           \
    \ 2\n          \n        \n        \n          H\n        \n        =\n      \
    \  \n          λ\n          \n            −\n            2\n          \n     \
    \   \n        \n          H\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle\
    \ \\nabla ^{2}\\mathbf {H} =\\lambda ^{-2}\\mathbf {H} \\,}\n  \n where H is the\
    \ magnetic field and λ is the London penetration depth.\nThis equation, which\
    \ is known as the London equation, predicts that the magnetic field in a superconductor\
    \ decays exponentially from whatever value it possesses at the surface.\nA superconductor\
    \ with little or no magnetic field within it is said to be in the Meissner state.\
    \ The Meissner state breaks down when the applied magnetic field is too large.\
    \ Superconductors can be divided into two classes according to how this breakdown\
    \ occurs. In Type I superconductors, superconductivity is abruptly destroyed when\
    \ the strength of the applied field rises above a critical value Hc. Depending\
    \ on the geometry of the sample, one may obtain an intermediate state consisting\
    \ of a baroque pattern of regions of normal material carrying a magnetic field\
    \ mixed with regions of superconducting material containing no field. In Type\
    \ II superconductors, raising the applied field past a critical value Hc1 leads\
    \ to a mixed state (also known as the vortex state) in which an increasing amount\
    \ of magnetic flux penetrates the material, but there remains no resistance to\
    \ the flow of electric current as long as the current is not too large. At a second\
    \ critical field strength Hc2, superconductivity is destroyed. The mixed state\
    \ is actually caused by vortices in the electronic superfluid, sometimes called\
    \ fluxons because the flux carried by these vortices is quantized. Most pure elemental\
    \ superconductors, except niobium and carbon nanotubes, are Type I, while almost\
    \ all impure and compound superconductors are Type II.\n\n\n=== London moment\
    \ ===\n\nConversely, a spinning superconductor generates a magnetic field, precisely\
    \ aligned with the spin axis. The effect, the London moment, was put to good use\
    \ in Gravity Probe B. This experiment measured the magnetic fields of four superconducting\
    \ gyroscopes to determine their spin axes. This was critical to the experiment\
    \ since it is one of the few ways to accurately determine the spin axis of an\
    \ otherwise featureless sphere.\n\n\n== High-temperature superconductivity ==\n\
    \n\n== Applications ==\n\nSuperconductors are promising candidate materials for\
    \ devising fundamental circuit elements of electronic, spintronic, and quantum\
    \ technologies. One such example is a superconducting diode, in which supercurrent\
    \ flows along one direction only, that promise dissipationless superconducting\
    \ and semiconducting-superconducting hybrid technologies.\nSuperconducting magnets\
    \ are some of the most powerful electromagnets known. They are used in MRI/NMR\
    \ machines, mass spectrometers, the beam-steering magnets used in particle accelerators\
    \ and plasma confining magnets in some tokamaks. They can also be used for magnetic\
    \ separation, where weakly magnetic particles are extracted from a background\
    \ of less or non-magnetic particles, as in the pigment industries. They can also\
    \ be used in large wind turbines to overcome the restrictions imposed by high\
    \ electrical currents, with an industrial grade 3.6 megawatt superconducting windmill\
    \ generator having been tested successfully in Denmark.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s,\
    \ superconductors were used to build experimental digital computers using cryotron\
    \ switches. More recently, superconductors have been used to make digital circuits\
    \ based on rapid single flux quantum technology and RF and microwave filters for\
    \ mobile phone base stations.\nSuperconductors are used to build Josephson junctions\
    \ which are the building blocks of SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference\
    \ devices), the most sensitive magnetometers known. SQUIDs are used in scanning\
    \ SQUID microscopes and magnetoencephalography. Series of Josephson devices are\
    \ used to realize the SI volt. Superconducting photon detectors can be realised\
    \ in a variety of device configurations. Depending on the particular mode of operation,\
    \ a superconductor–insulator–superconductor Josephson junction can be used as\
    \ a photon detector or as a mixer. The large resistance change at the transition\
    \ from the normal to the superconducting state is used to build thermometers in\
    \ cryogenic micro-calorimeter photon detectors. The same effect is used in ultrasensitive\
    \ bolometers made from superconducting materials. Superconducting nanowire single-photon\
    \ detectors offer high speed, low noise single-photon detection and have been\
    \ employed widely in advanced photon-counting applications.\nOther early markets\
    \ are arising where the relative efficiency, size and weight advantages of devices\
    \ based on high-temperature superconductivity outweigh the additional costs involved.\
    \ For example, in wind turbines the lower weight and volume of superconducting\
    \ generators could lead to savings in construction and tower costs, offsetting\
    \ the higher costs for the generator and lowering the total levelized cost of\
    \ electricity (LCOE).\nPromising future applications include high-performance\
    \ smart grid, electric power transmission, transformers, power storage devices,\
    \ compact fusion power devices, electric motors (e.g. for vehicle propulsion,\
    \ as in vactrains or maglev trains), magnetic levitation devices, fault current\
    \ limiters, enhancing spintronic devices with superconducting materials, and superconducting\
    \ magnetic refrigeration. However, superconductivity is sensitive to moving magnetic\
    \ fields, so applications that use alternating current (e.g. transformers) will\
    \ be more difficult to develop than those that rely upon direct current. Compared\
    \ to traditional power lines, superconducting transmission lines are more efficient\
    \ and require only a fraction of the space, which would not only lead to a better\
    \ environmental performance but could also improve public acceptance for expansion\
    \ of the electric grid. Another attractive industrial aspect is the ability for\
    \ high power transmission at lower voltages. Advancements in the efficiency of\
    \ cooling systems and use of cheap coolants such as liquid nitrogen have also\
    \ significantly decreased cooling costs needed for superconductivity.\n\n\n==\
    \ Nobel Prizes ==\nAs of 2022, there have been five Nobel Prizes in Physics for\
    \ superconductivity related subjects:\n\nHeike Kamerlingh Onnes (1913), \"for\

    'what is abrikosov vortex',
    "In superconductivity, a fluxon (also called an Abrikosov vortex or quantum vortex) is a vortex of supercurrent in a type-II superconductor, used by Soviet physicist Alexei Abrikosov to explain magnetic behavior of type-II superconductors. Abrikosov vortices occur generically in the Ginzburg–Landau theory of superconductivity.\n\n\n== Overview ==\nThe solution is a combination of fluxon solution by Fritz London, combined with a concept of core of quantum  vortex by Lars Onsager.\nIn the quantum vortex, supercurrent circulates around the normal (i.e. non-superconducting) core of the vortex. The core has a size \n  \n    \n      \n        ∼\n        ξ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sim \\xi }\n  \n — the superconducting coherence length (parameter of a Ginzburg–Landau theory). The supercurrents decay on the distance about \n  \n    \n      \n        λ\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda }\n  \n (London penetration depth) from the core. Note that in type-II superconductors \n  \n    \n      \n        λ\n        >\n        ξ\n        \n          /\n        \n        \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\lambda >\\xi /{\\sqrt {2}}}\n  \n. The circulating supercurrents induce magnetic fields with the total flux equal to a single flux quantum \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Φ\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Phi _{0}}\n  \n.

    'Superconductivity is a set of physical properties observed in superconductors: materials where electrical resistance vanishes and magnetic fields are expelled from the material. Unlike an ordinary metallic conductor, whose resistance decreases gradually as its temperature is lowered, even down to near absolute zero, a superconductor has a characteristic critical temperature below which the resistance drops abruptly to zero. An electric current through a loop of superconducting wire can persist indefinitely with no power source.\nThe superconductivity phenomenon was discovered in 1911 by Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes. Like ferromagnetism and atomic spectral lines, superconductivity is a phenomenon which can only be explained by quantum mechanics. It is characterized by the Meissner effect, the complete cancellation of the magnetic field in the interior of the superconductor during its transitions into the superconducting state. The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity cannot be understood simply as the idealization of perfect conductivity in classical physics.\nIn 1986, it was discovered that some cuprate-perovskite ceramic materials have a critical temperature above 35 K (−238 °C). It was shortly found (by Ching-Wu Chu) that replacing the lanthanum with yttrium, i.e. making YBCO, raised the critical temperature to 92 K (−181 °C), which was important because liquid nitrogen could then be used as a refrigerant. Such a high transition temperature is theoretically impossible for a conventional superconductor, leading the materials to be termed high-temperature superconductors. The cheaply available coolant liquid nitrogen boils at 77 K (−196 °C) and thus the existence of superconductivity at higher temperatures than this facilitates many experiments and applications that are less practical at lower temperatures.\n\n\n== History ==\n\nSuperconductivity was discovered on April 8, 1911, by Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, who was studying the resistance of solid mercury at cryogenic temperatures using the recently produced liquid helium as a refrigerant. At the temperature of 4.2 K, he observed that the resistance abruptly disappeared. In the same experiment, he also observed the superfluid transition of helium at 2.2 K, without recognizing its significance. The precise date and circumstances of the discovery were only reconstructed a century later, when Onnes\'s notebook was found. In subsequent decades, superconductivity was observed in several other materials. In 1913, lead was found to superconduct at 7 K, and in 1941 niobium nitride was found to superconduct at 16 K.\nGreat efforts have been devoted to finding out how and why superconductivity works; the important step occurred in 1933, when Meissner and Ochsenfeld discovered that superconductors expelled applied magnetic fields, a phenomenon which has come to be known as the Meissner effect. In 1935, Fritz and Heinz London showed that the Meissner effect was a consequence of the minimization of the electromagnetic free energy carried by superconducting current.\n\n\n=== London constitutive equations ===\nThe theoretical model that was first conceived for superconductivity was completely classical: it is summarized by London constitutive equations. It was put forward by the brothers Fritz and Heinz London in 1935, shortly after the discovery that magnetic fields are expelled from superconductors. A major triumph of the equations of this theory is their ability to explain the Meissner effect, wherein a material exponentially expels all internal magnetic fields as it crosses the superconducting threshold. By using the London equation, one can obtain the dependence of the magnetic field inside the superconductor on the distance to the surface.\nThe two constitutive equations for a superconductor by London are:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              ∂\n              \n                j\n              \n            \n            \n              ∂\n              t\n            \n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              n\n              \n                e\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n            m\n          \n        \n        \n          E\n        \n        ,\n        \n        \n          ∇\n        \n        ×\n        \n          j\n        \n        =\n        −\n        \n          \n            \n              n\n              \n                e\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n            m\n          \n        \n        \n          B\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {\\partial \\mathbf {j} }{\\partial t}}={\\frac {ne^{2}}{m}}\\mathbf {E} ,\\qquad \\mathbf {\\nabla } \\times \\mathbf {j} =-{\\frac {ne^{2}}{m}}\\mathbf {B} .}\n  \n\nThe first equation follows from Newton\'s second law for superconducting electrons.\n\n\n=== Conventional theories (1950s) ===\nDuring the 1950s, theoretical condensed matter physicists arrived at an understanding of "conventional" superconductivity, through a pair of remarkable and important theories: the phenomenological Ginzburg–Landau theory (1950) and the microscopic BCS theory (1957).\nIn 1950, the phenomenological Ginzburg–Landau theory of superconductivity was devised by Landau and Ginzburg. This theory, which combined Landau\'s theory of second-order phase transitions with a Schrödinger-like wave equation, had great success in explaining the macroscopic properties of superconductors. In particular, Abrikosov showed that Ginzburg–Landau theory predicts the division of superconductors into the two categories now referred to as Type I and Type II. Abrikosov and Ginzburg were awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize for their work (Landau had received the 1962 Nobel Prize for other work, and died in 1968). The four-dimensional extension of the Ginzburg–Landau theory, the Coleman-Weinberg model, is important in quantum field theory and cosmology.\nAlso in 1950, Maxwell and Reynolds et al. found that the critical temperature of a superconductor depends on the isotopic mass of the constituent element. This important discovery pointed to the electron–phonon interaction as the microscopic mechanism responsible for superconductivity.\nThe complete microscopic theory of superconductivity was finally proposed in 1957 by Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer. This BCS theory explained the superconducting current as a superfluid of Cooper pairs, pairs of electrons interacting through the exchange of phonons. For this work, the authors were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1972.\nThe BCS theory was set on a firmer footing in 1958, when N. N. Bogolyubov showed that the BCS wavefunction, which had originally been derived from a variational argument, could be obtained using a canonical transformation of the electronic Hamiltonian. In 1959, Lev Gor\'kov showed that the BCS theory reduced to the Ginzburg–Landau theory close to the critical temperature.\nGeneralizations of BCS theory for conventional superconductors form the basis for the understanding of the phenomenon of superfluidity, because they fall into the lambda transition universality class. The extent to which such generalizations can be applied to unconventional superconductors is still controversial.\n\n\n=== Niobium ===\nThe first practical application of superconductivity was developed in 1954 with Dudley Allen Buck\'s invention of the cryotron. Two superconductors with greatly different values of the critical magnetic field are combined to produce a fast, simple switch for computer elements.\nSoon after discovering superconductivity in 1911, Kamerlingh Onnes attempted to make an electromagnet with superconducting windings but found that relatively low magnetic fields destroyed superconductivity in the materials he investigated. Much later, in 1955, G. B. Yntema succeeded in constructing a small 0.7-tesla iron-core electromagnet with superconducting niobium wire windings. Then, in 1961, J. E. Kunzler, E. Buehler, F. S. L. Hsu, and J. H. Wernick made the startling discovery that, at 4.2 kelvin, niobium–tin, a compound consisting of three parts niobium and one part tin, was capable of supporting a current density of more than 100,000 amperes per square centimeter in a magnetic field of 8.8 tesla. The alloy was brittle and difficult to fabricate, but niobium–tin proved useful for generating magnetic fields as high as 20 tesla.\nIn 1962, T. G. Berlincourt and R. R. Hake discovered that more ductile alloys of niobium and titanium are suitable for applications up to 10 tesla. Commercial production of niobium–titanium supermagnet wire immediately commenced at Westinghouse Electric Corporation and at Wah Chang Corporation. Although niobium–titanium boasts less-impressive superconducting properties than those of niobium–tin, niobium–titanium became the most widely used "workhorse" supermagnet material, in large measure a consequence of its very high ductility and ease of fabrication. However, both niobium–tin and niobium–titanium found wide application in MRI medical imagers, bending and focusing magnets for enormous high-energy-particle accelerators, and other applications. Conectus, a European superconductivity consortium, estimated that in 2014, global economic activity for which superconductivity was indispensable amounted to about five billion euros, with MRI systems accounting for about 80% of that total.\n\n\n=== Josephson effect ===\nIn 1962, Josephson made the important theoretical prediction that a supercurrent can flow between two pieces of superconductor separated by a thin layer of insulator. This phenomenon, now called the Josephson effect, is exploited by superconducting devices such as SQUIDs. It is used in the most accurate available measurements of the magnetic flux quantum Φ0 = h/(2e), where h is the Planck constant. Coupled with the quantum Hall resistivity, this leads to a precise measurement of the Planck constant. Josephson was awarded the Nobel Prize for this work in 1973.\nIn 2008, it was proposed that the same mechanism that produces superconductivity could produce a superinsulator state in some materials, with almost infinite electrical resistance. The first development and study of superconducting Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) in 2020 suggested a "smooth transition between" BEC and Bardeen-Cooper-Shrieffer regimes.\n\n\n=== 2D materials ===\nMultiple types of superconductivity are reported in devices made of single-layer materials. Some of these materials can switch between conducting, insulating, and other behaviors.\nTwisting materials imbues them with a "moiré" pattern involving tiled hexagonal cells that act like atoms and host electrons. In this environment, the electrons move slowly enough for their collective interactions to guide their behavior. When each cell has a single electron, the electrons take on an antiferromagnetic arrangement; each electron can have a preferred location and magnetic orientation. Their intrinsic magnetic fields tend to alternate between pointing up and down. Adding electrons allows superconductivity by causing Cooper pairs to form. Fu and Schrade argued that electron-on-electron action was allowing both antiferromagnetic and superconducting states.\nThe first success with 2D materials involved a twisted bilayer graphene sheet (2018, Tc ~1.7 K, 1.1° twist). A twisted three-layer graphene device was later shown to superconduct (2021, Tc ~2.8 K). Then an untwisted trilayer graphene device was reported to superconduct (2022, Tc 1-2 K). The latter was later shown to be tunable, easily reproducing behavior found in millions of other configurations. Directly observing what happens when electrons are added to a material or slightly weakening its electric field enables quick testing of an unprecedented number of recipes to see which lead to superconductivity.\nIn four and five layer rhombohedral graphene, a form of superconductivity with spontaneously broken time reversal symmetry known as "chiral superconductivity" was recently observed. These systems were not observed to have any superlattice effects, and they can flip between two possible magnetic states without exiting the superconducting phase. This is in strong contrast to other observations of superconductivity and magnetic fields. \nThese devices have applications in quantum computing.\n2D materials other than graphene have also been made to superconduct. Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) sheets twisted at 5 degrees intermittently achieved superconduction by creating a Josephson junction. The device used used thin layers of palladium to connect to the sides of a tungsten telluride layer surrounded and protected by boron nitride. Another group demonstrated superconduction in molybdenum telluride (MoTe₂) in 2D van der Waals materials using ferroelectric domain walls. The Tc was implied to be higher than typical TMDs (~5–10 K).\nA Cornell group added a 3.5-degree twist to an insulator that allowed electrons to slow down and interact strongly, leaving one electron per cell, exhibiting superconduction. Existing theories do not explain this behavior.\nFu and collaborators proposed that electrons arrange to form a repeating crystal that allows the electron grid to float independently of the background atomic nuclei and the electron grid to relax. Its ripples pair electrons the way phonons do, although this is unconfirmed.\n\n\n== Classification ==\n\nSuperconductors are classified according to many criteria. The most common are:\n\n\n=== Response to a magnetic field ===\nA superconductor can be Type I, meaning it has a single critical field, above which superconductivity is lost and below which the magnetic field is completely expelled from the superconductor; or Type II, meaning it has two critical fields, between which it allows partial penetration of the magnetic field through isolated points called vortices. Furthermore, in multicomponent superconductors it is possible to combine the two behaviours. In that case the superconductor is of Type-1.5.\n\n\n=== Theory of operation ===\nA superconductor is conventional if it is driven by electron–phonon interaction and explained by the BCS theory or its extension, the Eliashberg theory. Otherwise, it is unconventional. Alternatively, a superconductor is called unconventional if the superconducting order parameter transforms according to a non-trivial irreducible representation of the system\'s point group or space group.\n\n\n=== Critical temperature ===\nA superconductor is generally considered high-temperature if it reaches a superconducting state above a temperature of 30 K (−243.15 °C); as in the initial discovery by Georg Bednorz and K. Alex Müller. It may also reference materials that transition to superconductivity when cooled using liquid nitrogen – that is, at only Tc > 77 K, although this is generally used only to emphasize that liquid nitrogen coolant is sufficient. Low temperature superconductors refer to materials with a critical temperature below 30 K, and are cooled mainly by liquid helium (Tc > 4.2 K). One exception to this rule is the iron pnictide group of superconductors that display behaviour and properties typical of high-temperature superconductors, yet some of the group have critical temperatures below 30 K.\n\n\n=== Material ===\n\nSuperconductor material classes include chemical elements (e.g. mercury or lead), alloys (such as niobium–titanium, germanium–niobium, and niobium nitride), ceramics (YBCO and magnesium diboride), superconducting pnictides (like fluorine-doped LaOFeAs), single-layer materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides, or organic superconductors (fullerenes and carbon nanotubes; though perhaps these examples should be included among the chemical elements, as they are composed entirely of carbon).\n\n\n== Elementary properties ==\n\nSeveral physical properties of superconductors vary from material to material, such as the critical temperature, the value of the superconducting gap, the critical magnetic field, and the critical current density at which superconductivity is destroyed. On the other hand, there is a class of properties that are independent of the underlying material. The Meissner effect, the quantization of the magnetic flux or permanent currents, i.e. the state of zero resistance are the most important examples. The existence of these "universal" properties is rooted in the nature of the broken symmetry of the superconductor and the emergence of off-diagonal long range order. Superconductivity is a thermodynamic phase, and thus possesses certain distinguishing properties which are largely independent of microscopic details. Off diagonal long range order is closely connected to the formation of Cooper pairs.\n\n\n=== Zero electrical DC resistance ===\n\nThe simplest method to measure the electrical resistance of a sample of some material is to place it in an electrical circuit in series with a current source I and measure the resulting voltage V across the sample. The resistance of the sample is given by Ohm\'s law as R = V / I. If the voltage is zero, this means that the resistance is zero.\nSuperconductors are also able to maintain a current with no applied voltage whatsoever, a property exploited in superconducting electromagnets such as those found in MRI machines. Experiments have demonstrated that currents in superconducting coils can persist for years without any measurable degradation. Experimental evidence points to a lifetime of at least 100,000 years. Theoretical estimates for the lifetime of a persistent current can exceed the estimated lifetime of the universe, depending on the wire geometry and the temperature. In practice, currents injected in superconducting coils persisted for 28 years, 7 months, 27 days in a superconducting gravimeter in Belgium, from August 4, 1995 until March 31, 2024. In such instruments, the measurement is based on the monitoring of the levitation of a superconducting niobium sphere with a mass of four grams.\nIn a normal conductor, an electric current may be visualized as a fluid of electrons moving across a heavy ionic lattice. The electrons are constantly colliding with the ions in the lattice, and during each collision some of the energy carried by the current is absorbed by the lattice and converted into heat, which is essentially the vibrational kinetic energy of the lattice ions. As a result, the energy carried by the current is constantly being dissipated. This is the phenomenon of electrical resistance and Joule heating.\nThe situation is different in a superconductor. In a conventional superconductor, the electronic fluid cannot be resolved into individual electrons. Instead, it consists of bound pairs of electrons known as Cooper pairs. This pairing is caused by an attractive force between electrons from the exchange of phonons. This pairing is very weak, and small thermal vibrations can fracture the bond. Due to quantum mechanics, the energy spectrum of this Cooper pair fluid possesses an energy gap, meaning there is a minimum amount of energy ΔE that must be supplied in order to excite the fluid. Therefore, if ΔE is larger than the thermal energy of the lattice, given by kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature, the fluid will not be scattered by the lattice. The Cooper pair fluid is thus a superfluid, meaning it can flow without energy dissipation.\nIn the class of superconductors known as type II superconductors, including all known high-temperature superconductors, an extremely low but non-zero resistivity appears at temperatures not too far below the nominal superconducting transition when an electric current is applied in conjunction with a strong magnetic field, which may be caused by the electric current. This is due to the motion of magnetic vortices in the electronic superfluid, which dissipates some of the energy carried by the current. If the current is sufficiently small, the vortices are stationary, and the resistivity vanishes. The resistance due to this effect is minuscule compared with that of non-superconducting materials, but must be taken into account in sensitive experiments. However, as the temperature decreases far enough below the nominal superconducting transition, these vortices can become frozen into a disordered but stationary phase known as a "vortex glass". Below this vortex glass transition temperature, the resistance of the material becomes truly zero.\n\n\n=== Phase transition ===\n\nIn superconducting materials, the characteristics of superconductivity appear when the temperature T is lowered below a critical temperature Tc. The value of this critical temperature varies from material to material. Conventional superconductors usually have critical temperatures ranging from around 20 K to less than 1 K. Solid mercury, for example, has a critical temperature of 4.2 K. As of 2015, the highest critical temperature found for a conventional superconductor is 203 K for H2S, although high pressures of approximately 90 gigapascals were required. Cuprate superconductors can have much higher critical temperatures: YBa2Cu3O7, one of the first cuprate superconductors to be discovered, has a critical temperature above 90 K, and mercury-based cuprates have been found with critical temperatures in excess of 130 K. The basic physical mechanism responsible for the high critical temperature is not yet clear. However, it is clear that a two-electron pairing is involved, although the nature of the pairing (\n  \n    \n      \n        s\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle s}\n  \n wave vs. \n  \n    \n      \n        d\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle d}\n  \n wave) remains controversial.\nSimilarly, at a fixed temperature below the critical temperature, superconducting materials cease to superconduct when an external magnetic field is applied which is greater than the critical magnetic field. This is because the Gibbs free energy of the superconducting phase increases quadratically with the magnetic field while the free energy of the normal phase is roughly independent of the magnetic field. If the material superconducts in the absence of a field, then the superconducting phase free energy is lower than that of the normal phase and so for some finite value of the magnetic field (proportional to the square root of the difference of the free energies at zero magnetic field) the two free energies will be equal and a phase transition to the normal phase will occur. More generally, a higher temperature and a stronger magnetic field lead to a smaller fraction of electrons that are superconducting and consequently to a longer London penetration depth of external magnetic fields and currents. The penetration depth becomes infinite at the phase transition.\nThe onset of superconductivity is accompanied by abrupt changes in various physical properties, which is the hallmark of a phase transition. For example, the electronic heat capacity is proportional to the temperature in the normal (non-superconducting) regime. At the superconducting transition, it suffers a discontinuous jump and thereafter ceases to be linear. At low temperatures, it varies instead as e−α/T for some constant, α. This exponential behavior is one of the pieces of evidence for the existence of the energy gap.\nThe order of the superconducting phase transition was long a matter of debate. Experiments indicate that the transition is second-order, meaning there is no latent heat. However, in the presence of an external magnetic field there is latent heat, because the superconducting phase has a lower entropy below the critical temperature than the normal phase. It has been experimentally demonstrated that, as a consequence, when the magnetic field is increased beyond the critical field, the resulting phase transition leads to a decrease in the temperature of the superconducting material.\nCalculations in the 1970s suggested that it may actually be weakly first-order due to the effect of long-range fluctuations in the electromagnetic field. In the 1980s it was shown theoretically with the help of a disorder field theory, in which the vortex lines of the superconductor play a major role, that the transition is of second order within the type II regime and of first order (i.e., latent heat) within the type I regime, and that the two regions are separated by a tricritical point. The results were strongly supported by Monte Carlo computer simulations.\n\n\n=== Meissner effect ===\n\nWhen a superconductor is placed in a weak external magnetic field H, and cooled below its transition temperature, the magnetic field is ejected. The Meissner effect does not cause the field to be completely ejected but instead, the field penetrates the superconductor but only to a very small distance, characterized by a parameter λ, called the London penetration depth, decaying exponentially to zero within the bulk of the material. The Meissner effect is a defining characteristic of superconductivity. For most superconductors, the London penetration depth is on the order of 100 nm.\nThe Meissner effect is sometimes confused with the kind of diamagnetism one would expect in a perfect electrical conductor: according to Lenz\'s law, when a changing magnetic field is applied to a conductor, it will induce an electric current in the conductor that creates an opposing magnetic field. In a perfect conductor, an arbitrarily large current can be induced, and the resulting magnetic field exactly cancels the applied field.\nThe Meissner effect is distinct from this – it is the spontaneous expulsion that occurs during transition to superconductivity. Suppose we have a material in its normal state, containing a constant internal magnetic field. When the material is cooled below the critical temperature, we would observe the abrupt expulsion of the internal magnetic field, which we would not expect based on Lenz\'s law.\nThe Meissner effect was given a phenomenological explanation by the brothers Fritz and Heinz London, who showed that the electromagnetic free energy in a superconductor is minimized provided \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          ∇\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          H\n        \n        =\n        \n          λ\n          \n            −\n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          H\n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\nabla ^{2}\\mathbf {H} =\\lambda ^{-2}\\mathbf {H} \\,}\n  \n where H is the magnetic field and λ is the London penetration depth.\nThis equation, which is known as the London equation, predicts that the magnetic field in a superconductor decays exponentially from whatever value it possesses at the surface.\nA superconductor with little or no magnetic field within it is said to be in the Meissner state. The Meissner state breaks down when the applied magnetic field is too large. Superconductors can be divided into two classes according to how this breakdown occurs. In Type I superconductors, superconductivity is abruptly destroyed when the strength of the applied field rises above a critical value Hc. Depending on the geometry of the sample, one may obtain an intermediate state consisting of a baroque pattern of regions of normal material carrying a magnetic field mixed with regions of superconducting material containing no field. In Type II superconductors, raising the applied field past a critical value Hc1 leads to a mixed state (also known as the vortex state) in which an increasing amount of magnetic flux penetrates the material, but there remains no resistance to the flow of electric current as long as the current is not too large. At a second critical field strength Hc2, superconductivity is destroyed. The mixed state is actually caused by vortices in the electronic superfluid, sometimes called fluxons because the flux carried by these vortices is quantized. Most pure elemental superconductors, except niobium and carbon nanotubes, are Type I, while almost all impure and compound superconductors are Type II.\n\n\n=== London moment ===\n\nConversely, a spinning superconductor generates a magnetic field, precisely aligned with the spin axis. The effect, the London moment, was put to good use in Gravity Probe B. This experiment measured the magnetic fields of four superconducting gyroscopes to determine their spin axes. This was critical to the experiment since it is one of the few ways to accurately determine the spin axis of an otherwise featureless sphere.\n\n\n== High-temperature superconductivity ==\n\n\n== Applications ==\n\nSuperconductors are promising candidate materials for devising fundamental circuit elements of electronic, spintronic, and quantum technologies. One such example is a superconducting diode, in which supercurrent flows along one direction only, that promise dissipationless superconducting and semiconducting-superconducting hybrid technologies.\nSuperconducting magnets are some of the most powerful electromagnets known. They are used in MRI/NMR machines, mass spectrometers, the beam-steering magnets used in particle accelerators and plasma confining magnets in some tokamaks. They can also be used for magnetic separation, where weakly magnetic particles are extracted from a background of less or non-magnetic particles, as in the pigment industries. They can also be used in large wind turbines to overcome the restrictions imposed by high electrical currents, with an industrial grade 3.6 megawatt superconducting windmill generator having been tested successfully in Denmark.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, superconductors were used to build experimental digital computers using cryotron switches. More recently, superconductors have been used to make digital circuits based on rapid single flux quantum technology and RF and microwave filters for mobile phone base stations.\nSuperconductors are used to build Josephson junctions which are the building blocks of SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices), the most sensitive magnetometers known. SQUIDs are used in scanning SQUID microscopes and magnetoencephalography. Series of Josephson devices are used to realize the SI volt. Superconducting photon detectors can be realised in a variety of device configurations. Depending on the particular mode of operation, a superconductor–insulator–superconductor Josephson junction can be used as a photon detector or as a mixer. The large resistance change at the transition from the normal to the superconducting state is used to build thermometers in cryogenic micro-calorimeter photon detectors. The same effect is used in ultrasensitive bolometers made from superconducting materials. Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors offer high speed, low noise single-photon detection and have been employed widely in advanced photon-counting applications.\nOther early markets are arising where the relative efficiency, size and weight advantages of devices based on high-temperature superconductivity outweigh the additional costs involved. For example, in wind turbines the lower weight and volume of superconducting generators could lead to savings in construction and tower costs, offsetting the higher costs for the generator and lowering the total levelized cost of electricity (LCOE).\nPromising future applications include high-performance smart grid, electric power transmission, transformers, power storage devices, compact fusion power devices, electric motors (e.g. for vehicle propulsion, as in vactrains or maglev trains), magnetic levitation devices, fault current limiters, enhancing spintronic devices with superconducting materials, and superconducting magnetic refrigeration. However, superconductivity is sensitive to moving magnetic fields, so applications that use alternating current (e.g. transformers) will be more difficult to develop than those that rely upon direct current. Compared to traditional power lines, superconducting transmission lines are more efficient and require only a fraction of the space, which would not only lead to a better environmental performance but could also improve public acceptance for expansion of the electric grid. Another attractive industrial aspect is the ability for high power transmission at lower voltages. Advancements in the efficiency of cooling systems and use of cheap coolants such as liquid nitrogen have also significantly decreased cooling costs needed for superconductivity.\n\n\n== Nobel Prizes ==\nAs of 2022, there have been five Nobel Prizes in Physics for superconductivity related subjects:\n\nHeike Kamerlingh Onnes (1913), "for his investigations on the properties of matter at low temperatures which led, inter alia, to the production of liquid helium".\nJohn Bardeen, Leon N. Cooper, and J. Robert Schrieffer (1972), "for their jointly developed theory of superconductivity, usually called the BCS-theory".\nLeo Esaki, Ivar Giaever, and Brian D. Josephson (1973), "for their experimental discoveries regarding tunneling phenomena in semiconductors and superconductors, respectively" and "for his theoretical predictions of the properties of a supercurrent through a tunnel barrier, in particular those phenomena which are generally known as the Josephson effects".\nGeorg Bednorz and K. Alex Müller (1987), "for their important break-through in the discovery of superconductivity in ceramic materials".\nAlexei A. Abrikosov, Vitaly L. Ginzburg, and Anthony J.

  | <code>superconductivity explained</code>     | <code>John Bardeen (23 May 1908 – 30 January 1991) was an American physicist and electrical engineer. He is the only person to win two Nobel Prizes in Physics. Early life Bardeen was born in Madison, Wisconsin. His father, Charles Bardeen was a Professor at the Medical School of the University of Wisconsin. He completed his bachelor's degree and master's degree in Electrical Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He completed his PhD in Physics at Princeton University in 1936. Works Bardeen worked with William Shockley and Walter Brattain to invent the transistor on 23 December 1947. They shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1956. Later, Bardeen worked with Leon Cooper and John Robert Schrieffer. They created the BCS theory of superconductivity, named after them. For this work they shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for 1972. Bardeen was a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign from 1951 to 1991.

In its initial form, it was postulated as a phenomenological model which could describe type-I superconductors without examining  their microscopic properties.

The theory can also be given a general geometric setting, placing it in the context of Riemannian geometry, where in many cases exact solutions can be given.
